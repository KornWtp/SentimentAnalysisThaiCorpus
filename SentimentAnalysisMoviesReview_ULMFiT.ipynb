The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better

minutes of actual film ) . xxmaj but what it can not explain is its lack of humor that the previous film possessed . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the gags are quick and sometimes not even funny . xxmaj the only true funny parts are the quick spoofs on the xxmaj nike basketball spots , xxmaj james xxmaj woods ' portrayal of xxmaj max xxmaj van xxmaj sydow 's character in the xxmaj exorcist , and bits and pieces scattered throughout the film . xxmaj very unfunny was the take off of xxmaj charlie 's xxmaj angels , which like the first xxmaj scary xxmaj movie and the xxmaj matrix spin off scene , basically recreated the scene without much humor injected into it . \n"," \n","  xxmaj today 's youth might not be able to relate to the spoof gags of the classic supernatural horror films of the 70

this one . its 3 hrs of unadulterated torture . from the starting u get the idea that the movie is gon na be bad . the acting is pathetic . i 'm a big fan of xxmaj ajay devgan ( loved him in bhagat singh ) but he is at his worst in this movie . amitabh seems to have worked hard for this one , but somehow the fear is missing . prashant raj is a non actor . and the most irritating part of the movie is nisha kothari . i have no clue why the director took her in this movie . the background score is repetitive . somehow i felt that ramu tried to repeat a sarkar , the color theme , the background score , the camera angles , but it did n't work . xxup please xxmaj do n't xxup watch xxup it,xxbos xxmaj despite having known people who are either great fans of xxmaj noam xxmaj chomsky ,

previous films , xxmaj woody xxmaj allen , now a xxunk , has xxup finally allowed a younger male lead to get the girl . \n"," \n","  xxmaj not so . xxmaj in fact , the plot is constructed in such a way so that the girl gets no one . \n"," \n","  xxmaj there is an early scene where xxmaj johansson , for no reason central to the movie , allows herself to be gotten drunk , and seduced , by a powerful , older director . \" xxmaj seduced \" is a euphemism for what happens . xxmaj it 's a \" slam , bam , i 've got ta go \" kind of moment . xxmaj it bears no relation to the plot whatsoever , and it cheapens xxmaj johansson in the viewer 's eye . xxmaj why did xxmaj allen add that unnecessary scene to the movie ? xxmaj because it shows a powerful director - like xxmaj allen - having sex with the female lead . xxmaj allen gets to have his cake and eat it , too . \n"," \n","  xxmaj johansson is not yet an actress . xxmaj she does n't know how to command the screen except by wearing a

function without a ghost , or an elderly and less than awe - inspiring magician , telling her what to do at every turn . \n"," \n","  xxmaj she is approximately half xxmaj jackman 's age , and she comes across as a very vapid screen presence in their scenes together . \n"," \n","  xxmaj audience members not obsessed with breasts deserve better in their heroines , and xxmaj jackman deserves better , too -- a script that gives the heroine some intelligence and agency , and an actress who can convey those qualities . \n"," \n","  xxmaj hugh xxmaj jackman is similarly cheated by the script . xxmaj allen apparently ca n't stand it that xxmaj jackman is so stunningly good looking and young , and so he gives xxmaj jackman nothing to say or do . xxmaj like xxmaj johansson , he is used merely for his good looks . xxmaj this is a shame , because , as xxmaj jackman has shown in any number of productions , from \" xxmaj oklahoma \" to \" x xxmaj men , \" he xxup can act . \n"," \n","  xxmaj here 's the big plot twist -- xxmaj jackman , suave , charming xxmaj english xxmaj lord , really is a killer . xxmaj so , though the movie says it is all about letting someone else , other than xxmaj allen , get the girl , she does n't get anyone . xxmaj jackman , the man she 's been making love to , is a man who murdered a prostitute . xxmaj nice , xxmaj woody . xxmaj nice way to punish your heroine for being beyond your grasp . \n"," \n","  xxmaj in a passive aggressive touch , xxmaj allen deprives his heroine of his own presence , as well , killing off his character , the magician , leaving xxmaj scarlett xxmaj johansson all alone at the end of the film . \n"," \n","  a final note : at my screening , not a single audience member laughed at any point during the film . xxmaj always a bad sign when a film is advertised as a comedy .,xxbos xxmaj who ? xxmaj what ? xxmaj where ? xxmaj when ? xxmaj why ? xxmaj the acting was terrible . xxmaj very robotic , rehearsed . i have

just peeking into with her daylight adventures . xxmaj by day she is very prim and demure , and her swain xxmaj henry treats her with the utmost courtesy . xxmaj but as her own sexual nature awakens , her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj at the beginning of the story , xxmaj catherine 's visions of sex are based entirely on the xxmaj gothic novels she devours in bed . xxmaj it is both heartwarming , sexy , and provocative to observe the way her dreamy picture of handsome xxmaj henry \" dissolves \" into a lurid dream of being carried off and ravished by romantic villains ! xxmaj at the same time , it is wry and touching to cut back to her bed in the morning -- xxmaj catherine sleeping peacefully looks so innocent one would never guess what really goes on in that pretty little head ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj later , after being invited to xxmaj henry 's castle , xxmaj catherine overhears a family argument and totally misunderstands its meaning . xxmaj jumping into bed , she covers herself up with the bedsheets and lies awake listening fearfully , her striking blue eyes the only visible sign that she is alert . xxmaj little by little , however , those pretty blue eyes xxunk and close as she drifts into another heated dream of innocent desire . xxmaj this time , xxmaj catherine dreams she is in xxmaj elizabethan times , waiting fearfully outside the castle for the approach of the \" xxunk ! \" xxmaj it 's pretty clear she is more excited than terrified by the idea of being carried off by bandits . xxmaj she all but shudders with excitement and anticipation ! xxmaj but then , after a shot of her running frantically to escape , we are back to the daylight world , where the maid is scolding her for having made a mess of her room before falling into a sound sleep . xxmaj it 's worth noting that xxmaj catherine 's heavy - eyed yawning in the morning light is itself a rather sensual symbol of how passionate her dreams have been ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj ultimately , of course , xxmaj catherine 's stern and unimaginative lover xxmaj henry xxunk the nature of her fantasies and gives her a stern lecture . xxmaj it 's interesting that xxmaj catherine 's immediate collapse into tears symbolizes not a retreat but an advance into adult relationships . xxmaj in the next scene , she tearfully burns her xxmaj gothic romance and throws herself xxunk and sobbing onto the bed . xxmaj significantly , this turning point is also marked by xxmaj catherine falling into a deep sleep -- except that this time , there are no

gives xxmaj jackman nothing to say or do . xxmaj like xxmaj johansson , he is used merely for his good looks . xxmaj this is a shame , because , as xxmaj jackman has shown in any number of productions , from \" xxmaj oklahoma \" to \" x xxmaj men , \" he xxup can act . \n"," \n","  xxmaj here 's the big plot twist -- xxmaj jackman , suave , charming xxmaj english xxmaj lord , really is a killer .

who murdered a prostitute . xxmaj nice , xxmaj woody . xxmaj nice way to punish your heroine for being beyond your grasp . \n"," \n","  xxmaj in a passive aggressive touch , xxmaj allen deprives his

came from me seeing this movie : i doubly admire xxup lost xxup in xxup translation now .,xxbos xxmaj do n't watch this movie expecting the xxmaj jane xxmaj austen wit , crisp dialog or clever social commentary . xxmaj this time around , the premise of xxmaj northanger xxmaj abbey has been updated in a very sensual way ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj in this version , xxmaj catherine 's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies , but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures . xxmaj by day she is very prim and demure , and her swain xxmaj henry treats her with the utmost courtesy . xxmaj but as her own sexual nature awakens , her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj at the beginning of the story , xxmaj catherine 's visions of sex are based entirely on the xxmaj gothic novels she devours in bed . xxmaj it is both heartwarming , sexy , and provocative to observe the way her dreamy picture of handsome xxmaj henry \" dissolves \" into a lurid dream of being carried off and ravished by romantic villains ! xxmaj at the same time , it is wry and touching to cut back to her bed in the morning -- xxmaj catherine sleeping peacefully looks so innocent one would never guess what really goes on in that pretty little head ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj later , after being invited to xxmaj henry 's castle , xxmaj catherine overhears a family argument and totally misunderstands its meaning . xxmaj jumping into bed , she covers herself up with the bedsheets and lies awake listening fearfully , her striking blue eyes the only visible sign that she is alert . xxmaj little by little , however , those pretty blue eyes xxunk and close as she drifts into another heated dream of innocent desire . xxmaj this time , xxmaj catherine dreams she is in xxmaj elizabethan times , waiting fearfully outside the castle for the approach of the \" xxunk ! \" xxmaj it 's pretty clear she is more excited than terrified by the idea of being carried off by bandits . xxmaj she all but shudders with excitement and anticipation ! xxmaj but then , after a shot of her running frantically to escape , we are back to the daylight world , where the maid is scolding her for having made a mess of her room before falling into a sound sleep . xxmaj it 's worth noting that xxmaj catherine 's heavy - eyed yawning in the morning light is itself a rather sensual symbol of how passionate her dreams have been ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj ultimately , of course , xxmaj catherine 's stern and unimaginative lover xxmaj henry xxunk the nature of her fantasies and gives her a stern lecture . xxmaj it 's interesting that xxmaj catherine 's immediate collapse into tears symbolizes not a retreat but an advance into adult relationships . xxmaj in the next scene , she tearfully burns her xxmaj gothic romance and throws herself xxunk and sobbing onto the bed . xxmaj significantly , this turning point is also marked by xxmaj catherine falling into a deep sleep -- except that this time , there are no dreams of make believe passion . xxmaj presumably , xxmaj catherine has matured enough to be ready for the real thing . \n"," \n","  xxmaj though xxmaj katherine xxmaj schlesinger has lovely blue eyes and a lively expression , and all her performance is charming , it must be said that outside of the heated dream sequences this movie adaptation is excruciatingly dull . i 'm giving it 9 stars only because the truly romantic may enjoy it purely on a daydream level . \n"," \n","  xxmaj if you 'd like to read a book about a genuinely strong willed young heroine who overcomes real darkness and danger in a real xxmaj gothic setting , i highly recommend xxup the xxup perilous xxup gard by xxmaj elizabeth xxmaj marie xxmaj pope .,xxbos xxmaj since \" xxmaj rugrats \" ' falling from the category of good and funny cartoon series to a mediocre and indeed outright horrible fare for two year olds in the past

classic supernatural horror films of the 70 's such as the xxmaj exorcist and maybe of the 80s ' xxmaj poltergeist , et . al . \n"," \n","  xxmaj hopefully xxmaj scary xxmaj movie 3 will take some time to put together , making the spoofs more enjoyable . \n"," \n","  xxmaj one thing though , the film features more than the last one of promising young actress xxmaj anna xxmaj faris ( whom i will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel ) . xxmaj just for her casting and acting ability , i give this movie a \" 3 \" out of \" 10 \" .,xxbos this is the first time i 'm writing a comment on a movie on imdb . but i had to write it for this one . its 3 hrs of unadulterated torture . from the starting u get the idea that the movie is gon na be bad . the acting is pathetic . i 'm a big fan of xxmaj ajay devgan ( loved him in bhagat singh ) but he is at his worst in this movie . amitabh seems to have worked hard for this one , but somehow the fear is missing . prashant raj is a non actor . and the most irritating part of the movie is nisha kothari . i have no clue why the director took her in this movie . the background score is repetitive . somehow i felt that ramu tried to repeat a sarkar , the color theme , the background score , the camera angles , but it did n't work . xxup please xxmaj do n't xxup watch xxup it,xxbos xxmaj despite having known people who are either great fans of xxmaj noam xxmaj chomsky , or think he 's a tired relic from the 1960s , i really had no opinion of the man , save that i knew he gained fame as a linguist , although i could not elucidate any of his theories , and that he was a liberal socialist with xxmaj marxist leanings . xxmaj so , stumbling across the xxup dvd of the 2003 documentary xxmaj noam xxmaj chomsky : xxmaj rebel xxmaj without a xxmaj pause , in a used video store , a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 9 - 11 , i decided to get it , just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person , pro or con , spoke of him . xxmaj while glad i got the film , my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was , so what 's all the fuss about ? \n"," \n","  xxmaj for a man with so many degrees , lauded as ' the most important intellectual alive ' , by the xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj times , according to the xxup dvd 's case , there sure was not a lot there , intellectually speaking . i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate , and i would n't even want to watch what a xxmaj william xxup f. xxmaj buckley could do to him . xxmaj granted , the whole film was seemingly about xxmaj chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere , and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he 'd say , rather than being on linguistics , so maybe that 's the reason he came off so badly . xxmaj but , again , if he is a linguist , and tops in his field , why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise ? \n"," . xxmaj even worse are his acolytes , who seem to further xxunk the man from reality , by fostering delusions that xxmaj chomsky is a target for xxmaj zionist assassins . xxmaj what little i knew of xxmaj chomsky before watching this film , this much i knew : he was generally considered a has been , and pretty much irrelevant intellectually , since the fall of the xxmaj soviet xxmaj empire . xxmaj the film is so poorly structured , and without a narrative thread , that it 's difficult to separate all of the jumble . xxmaj his wife , xxmaj carol , as example , apparently gave one interview , which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film . xxmaj she seems a nice enough woman , but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life . xxmaj the lone interesting thing she says is that 9 / 11 was a great thing for the xxmaj xxunk , for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then . \n"," \n","  xxmaj not surprisingly , this sort of film gives almost no biographical background . xxmaj it 's assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this ' great man ' bears . xxmaj chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one . xxmaj stylistically , there are no camera movements , no interesting edits , nor any signature touches , and most of the film is xxunk rambles by xxmaj chomsky , videotaped xxunk of xxmaj chomsky declaiming on this or that , and slack - jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial , that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him . xxmaj this is really poor film - making by director and editor xxmaj will xxmaj pascoe , who in the xxup dvd 's xxmaj filmmaker xxmaj statement , shows he 's yet another uncritical acolyte of xxmaj chomsky 's . xxmaj other than that , one of the xxunk signs that this is not an objective documentary , but mere agitprop , and a vanity piece of agitprop , at that , is that not a single time is xxmaj chomsky shown struggling with an answer . xxmaj he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds . \n"," \n","  xxmaj given that much of this dreck was filmed during xxmaj chomsky 's lectures at mcmaster xxmaj university , in xxmaj ontario , xxmaj canada , prior to the xxmaj american invasion of xxmaj iraq in 2003 , much of what xxmaj chomsky says seems as remote as things from the xxmaj vietnam xxmaj war era . xxmaj yes , he makes some good points , here and there , on xxmaj american media complicity before the war , but he follows them up with sheer lunacy , for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc , and not fully plotted out xxunk . xxmaj as example , he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace , but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled . xxmaj similarly , he claims xxmaj xxunk run the world and that people 's fear of crime is yet another cabal 's result . xxmaj of course , that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers , and all that wasted time and money district attorneys ' offices consume . xxmaj he also makes the absurd claim that xxmaj cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades , when xxmaj castro and company were great sponsors of it , in xxmaj latin xxmaj america , xxmaj asia , and xxmaj africa , until the xxmaj soviet xxmaj union fell . i can only guess that the xxup ufo xxunk are just waiting for xxmaj chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species - mixing impregnation centers up in xxmaj idaho . \n"," \n","  xxmaj in his simpleminded world without grays , xxmaj chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of xxmaj xxunk , whom he reviles , are ; even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals . xxmaj in short , xxmaj chomsky is a man living in the past , in over his head on most issues , and out of his depth intellectually . xxmaj near this film 's end he warns , ' xxmaj be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice , ' yet one can only laugh , as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he did n't like , no matter how barbarous their crimes , and anti - intellectual their posit . xxmaj please , pause before you waste your

there xxunk give xxunk for xxmaj the xxmaj stand -in ! ! !,xxbos xxup stranger xxup than xxup fiction angered me so much , i signed up on imdb just to write this review . xxup stranger xxup than xxup fiction is a surprisingly complex , touching and thought - provoking movie until the very end . xxmaj once you suspend multiple lapses of logic ( why did n't xxmaj will xxmaj ferrell hear xxmaj emma xxmaj thompson 's voice 10 years ago when she fist started writing her book ? \" xxmaj the phone rang . xxmaj the phone rang again . \" xxmaj how could she not know it 's him calling ? etc . ) , the movie challenges one 's thoughts about mortality , fate , and sacrifice . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the brief history of literary themes provided by xxmaj dustin xxmaj hoffman should especially entertain former xxmaj english majors . xxmaj and xxmaj maggie xxmaj gyllenhaal is always a pleasure , even though xxmaj will xxmaj ferrell might just as easily be an ax murderer as a bumbling soul . xxmaj her quick trust of him is a mighty big leap of faith . \n"," \n","  xxmaj ah , but the ending . xxmaj until the very end , i would have given 9 out of 10 stars to this movie . xxmaj the movie as a metaphor for life 's journey , as a tribute to the notion of ' writing true , ' as a reminder that great literature is either comedy or tragedy , but not both , is outstanding . xxmaj the entire movie leads the viewer to understand and accept the moment of xxmaj will xxmaj ferrell 's fate . xxmaj and no matter how endearing a character he may have become , we know full well why we will accept the ending . xxmaj the last act occurs , the screen goes white , the credits roll . a profound and powerful end to an almost perfect film . xxmaj an end that would have been debated for weeks . \n"," \n","  xxup no xxrep 10 ! xxmaj no credits rolled . xxmaj say it is n't so . xxmaj say xxmaj hollywood did n't tack on another 10 minutes of crap that completely undermined the integrity and heart of the movie . xxmaj dustin xxmaj hoffman got it right when he said , \" xxmaj it 's no longer a masterpiece ; it 's xxup ok . \" xxmaj an apt review of the movie . xxmaj except to me , it was n't even xxup ok . i was so offended about the betrayal of ' writing true , ' about the decision to pander the film that i actually burst into angry tears explaining this on the ride home from the movie . i do n't often cry . i could care less about most movies , but i am still angry about this one . \n"," \n","  xxmaj my questions for xxmaj zack xxmaj helm , the writer , are this : did the original movie end when the screen went white ? xxmaj and were you forced by the vapid movie powers - that - be to tack on an ending unfaithful to the core of the movie ? xxmaj or did you tack that maudlin ending on yourself ? i 've read you 're brilliant . i hope your original script ended the movie the first time . \n"," \n","  i know xxmaj zack xxmaj helm will never see this review , and i 've been unable to find a contact for him to ask myself . xxmaj but , please , movie - goers , am i the only one who feels this way about xxup stranger xxup than xxup fiction ? xxmaj one good thing came from me seeing this movie : i doubly admire xxup lost xxup in xxup translation now .,xxbos xxmaj do n't watch this movie expecting the xxmaj jane xxmaj austen wit , crisp dialog or clever social commentary . xxmaj this time around , the premise of xxmaj northanger xxmaj abbey has been updated in a very sensual way ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj in this version , xxmaj catherine 's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies , but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures . xxmaj by day she is very prim and demure , and her swain xxmaj henry treats her with the utmost courtesy . xxmaj but as her own sexual nature awakens , her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj at the beginning of the story , xxmaj catherine 's visions of sex are based entirely on the xxmaj gothic novels she devours in bed . xxmaj it is both heartwarming , sexy , and provocative to observe the way her dreamy picture of handsome xxmaj henry \" dissolves \" into a lurid dream of being carried off and ravished by romantic villains ! xxmaj at the same time , it is wry and touching to cut back to her bed in the morning -- xxmaj catherine sleeping peacefully looks so innocent one would never guess what really goes on in that pretty little head ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj later , after being invited to xxmaj henry 's castle , xxmaj catherine overhears a family argument and totally misunderstands its meaning . xxmaj jumping into bed , she covers herself up with the bedsheets and lies awake listening fearfully , her striking blue eyes the only visible sign that she is alert . xxmaj little by little , however , those pretty blue eyes xxunk and close as she drifts into another heated dream of innocent desire . xxmaj this time , xxmaj catherine dreams she is in xxmaj elizabethan times , waiting fearfully outside the castle for the approach of the \" xxunk ! \" xxmaj it 's pretty clear she is more excited than terrified by the idea of being carried off by bandits . xxmaj she all but shudders with excitement and anticipation ! xxmaj but then , after a shot of her running frantically to escape , we are back to the daylight world , where the maid is scolding her for having made a mess of her room before falling into a sound sleep . xxmaj it 's worth noting that xxmaj catherine 's heavy - eyed yawning in the morning light is itself a rather sensual symbol of how passionate her dreams have been ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj ultimately , of course , xxmaj catherine 's stern and unimaginative lover xxmaj henry xxunk the nature of her fantasies and gives her a stern lecture . xxmaj it 's interesting that xxmaj catherine 's immediate collapse into tears symbolizes not a retreat but an advance into adult relationships . xxmaj in the next scene , she tearfully burns her xxmaj gothic romance and throws herself xxunk and sobbing onto the bed . xxmaj significantly , this turning point is also marked by xxmaj catherine falling into a deep sleep -- except that this time , there are no dreams of make believe passion . xxmaj presumably , xxmaj catherine has matured enough to be ready for the real thing . \n"," \n","  xxmaj though xxmaj katherine xxmaj schlesinger has lovely blue eyes and a lively expression , and all her performance is charming , it must be said that outside of the heated dream sequences this movie adaptation is excruciatingly dull . i 'm giving it 9 stars only because the truly romantic may enjoy it purely on a daydream level . \n"," \n","  xxmaj if you 'd like to read a book about a genuinely strong willed young heroine who overcomes real darkness and danger in a real xxmaj gothic setting , i highly recommend xxup the xxup perilous xxup gard by xxmaj elizabeth xxmaj marie xxmaj pope .,xxbos xxmaj since \" xxmaj rugrats \" ' falling from the category of good and funny cartoon series to a mediocre and indeed outright horrible fare for two year olds in the past three or four years , obviously the tyrants at xxmaj klasky - xxmaj csupo should be out of ideas . xxmaj after dumbing down all of the characters , adding even stupider new ones , replacing some voices ( though i like xxmaj nancy xxmaj cartwright , she is xxup not xxmaj chucky xxmaj finster ! ) , and having no sense of continuity ( ex . : in a xxmaj kimi episode i watched the other day , xxmaj tommy and xxmaj chucky each got a new puppy ; but it subsequent episode , the aforementioned dogs never appear ) , you 'd think the creators could kill the show for mercy . xxmaj but n xxrep 4 o . \n"," \n","  xxmaj all i will say concerning this special is that it sucks ! xxmaj while not as horrible as the xxmaj kimi episodes , everyone is even stupider than they were , including xxmaj grandpa ( my xxmaj god ! xxmaj he used to be the best character on the show , but now , he has no real purpose ) . xxmaj the ending is needlessly fluffy , and the only thing different between this and other crappy new episodes ( ' xxunk ) is that the kids can interact with adults . xxmaj whoa , what fun ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj no stars at all for \" xxmaj the xxmaj rugrats xxmaj all xxmaj growed xxmaj up \" . xxmaj klasky - xxmaj csupo , please xxup destroy this show before it gets any worse .\n","y: LMLabelList\n",",,,,\n","Path: /root/.fastai/data/imdb;\n","\n","Test: None, model=SequentialRNN(\n","  (0):

this one . its 3 hrs of unadulterated torture . from the starting u get the idea that the movie is gon na be bad . the acting is pathetic . i 'm a big fan of xxmaj ajay devgan ( loved him in bhagat singh ) but he is at his worst in this movie . amitabh seems to have worked hard for this one , but somehow the fear is missing . prashant raj is a non actor . and the most irritating part of the movie is nisha kothari . i have no clue why the director took her in this movie . the background score is repetitive . somehow i felt that ramu tried to repeat a sarkar , the color theme , the background score , the camera angles , but it did n't work . xxup please xxmaj do n't xxup watch xxup it,xxbos xxmaj despite having known people who are either great fans of xxmaj noam xxmaj chomsky , or think he 's a tired relic from the 1960s , i really had no opinion of the man , save that i knew he gained fame as a linguist , although i could not elucidate any of his theories , and that he was a liberal socialist with xxmaj marxist leanings . xxmaj so , stumbling across the xxup dvd of the 2003 documentary xxmaj noam xxmaj chomsky : xxmaj rebel xxmaj without a xxmaj pause , in a used video store , a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 9 - 11 , i decided to get it , just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person , pro or con , spoke of him . xxmaj while glad i got the film , my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was , so what 's all the fuss about ? \n"," \n","  xxmaj for a man with so many degrees , lauded as ' the most important intellectual alive ' , by the xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj times , according to the xxup dvd 's case , there sure was not a lot there , intellectually speaking . i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate , and i would n't even want to watch what a xxmaj william xxup f. xxmaj buckley could do to him . xxmaj granted , the whole film was seemingly about xxmaj chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere , and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he 'd say , rather than being on linguistics , so maybe that 's the reason he came off so badly . xxmaj but , again , if he is a linguist , and tops in his field , why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise ? \n"," . xxmaj even worse are his acolytes , who seem to further xxunk the man from reality , by fostering delusions that xxmaj chomsky is a target for xxmaj zionist assassins . xxmaj what little i knew of xxmaj chomsky before watching this film , this much i knew : he was generally considered a has been , and pretty much irrelevant intellectually , since the fall of the xxmaj soviet xxmaj empire . xxmaj the film is so poorly structured , and without a narrative thread , that it 's difficult to separate all of the jumble . xxmaj his wife , xxmaj carol , as example , apparently gave one interview , which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film . xxmaj she seems a nice enough woman , but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life . xxmaj the lone interesting thing she says is that 9 / 11 was a great thing for the xxmaj xxunk , for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then . \n"," \n","  xxmaj not surprisingly , this sort of film gives almost no biographical background . xxmaj it 's assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this ' great man ' bears . xxmaj chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one . xxmaj stylistically , there are no camera movements , no interesting edits , nor any signature touches , and most of the film is xxunk rambles by xxmaj chomsky , videotaped xxunk of xxmaj chomsky declaiming on this or that , and slack - jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial , that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him . xxmaj this is really poor film - making by director and editor xxmaj will xxmaj pascoe , who in the xxup dvd 's xxmaj filmmaker xxmaj statement , shows he 's yet another uncritical acolyte of xxmaj chomsky 's . xxmaj other than that , one of the xxunk signs that this is not an objective documentary , but mere agitprop , and a vanity piece of agitprop , at that , is that not a single time is xxmaj chomsky shown struggling with an answer . xxmaj he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds . \n"," \n","  xxmaj given that much of this dreck was filmed during xxmaj chomsky 's lectures at mcmaster xxmaj university , in xxmaj ontario , xxmaj canada , prior to the xxmaj american invasion of xxmaj iraq in 2003 , much of what xxmaj chomsky says seems as remote as things from the xxmaj vietnam xxmaj war era . xxmaj yes , he makes some good points , here and there , on xxmaj american media complicity before the war , but he follows them up with sheer lunacy , for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc , and not fully plotted out xxunk . xxmaj as example , he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace , but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled . xxmaj similarly , he claims xxmaj xxunk run the world and that people 's fear of crime is yet another cabal 's result . xxmaj of course , that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers , and all that wasted time and money district attorneys ' offices consume . xxmaj he also makes the absurd claim that xxmaj cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades , when xxmaj castro and company were great sponsors of it , in xxmaj latin xxmaj america , xxmaj asia , and xxmaj africa , until the xxmaj soviet xxmaj union fell . i can only guess that the xxup ufo xxunk are just waiting for xxmaj chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species - mixing impregnation centers up in xxmaj idaho . \n"," \n","  xxmaj in his simpleminded world without grays , xxmaj chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of xxmaj xxunk , whom he reviles , are ; even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals . xxmaj in short , xxmaj chomsky is a man living in the past , in over his head on most issues , and out of his depth intellectually . xxmaj near this film 's end he warns , ' xxmaj be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice , ' yet one can only laugh , as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he did n't like , no matter how barbarous their crimes , and anti - intellectual their posit . xxmaj please , pause before you waste your time and money on this silly , and already irrelevant , xxup dvd .,xxbos xxup warning ! xxmaj this review will reveal the ending of the movie , \" xxmaj scoop . \" xxmaj if you do n't want to know how the movie ends , do n't read this review ! \n"," \n","  \" xxmaj scoop \" is so bad you 'll think \" xxmaj annie xxmaj hall \" was a fluke . \n"," \n","  xxmaj it gets one star because you get to see xxmaj hugh xxmaj jackman 's naked chest . xxmaj that 's the only thing \" xxmaj scoop \" has going for it . \n"," \n","  xxmaj woody xxmaj allen 's misogyny , and his fixation on women young enough , at this point , to be his granddaughter , has crippled any ability to make movies he may have had at any point . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the plot seems promising : a ghost , xxmaj ian mcshane , directs a fluffy headed student , xxmaj scarlett xxmaj johansson , to investigate whether or not an xxmaj english xxmaj lord , xxmaj hugh xxmaj jackman , is the notorious xxmaj tarot xxmaj card xxmaj killer of prostitutes . a magician , xxmaj woody xxmaj allen , helps the girl . \n"," \n","  xxmaj promising plot notwithstanding , the movie completely lacks charm , or humor , or atmosphere . xxmaj it 's an amazingly leaden , amateurish effort for someone who has made even one previous film , never mind dozens . xxmaj perhaps xxmaj allen has had a stroke that has gone unreported in the press . \n"," \n","  xxmaj much is made of the fact that unlike in his previous films , xxmaj woody xxmaj allen , now a xxunk , has xxup finally allowed a younger male lead to get the girl . \n"," \n","  xxmaj not so . xxmaj in fact , the plot is constructed in such a way so that the girl gets no one . \n"," \n","  xxmaj there is an early scene where xxmaj johansson , for no reason central to the movie , allows herself to be gotten drunk , and seduced , by a powerful , older director . \" xxmaj seduced \" is a euphemism for what happens . xxmaj it 's a \" slam , bam , i 've got ta go \" kind of moment . xxmaj it bears no relation to the plot whatsoever , and it cheapens xxmaj johansson in the viewer 's eye . xxmaj why did xxmaj allen add that unnecessary scene to the movie ? xxmaj because it shows a powerful director - like xxmaj allen - having sex with the female lead . xxmaj allen gets to have his cake and eat it , too . \n"," \n","  xxmaj johansson is not yet an actress . xxmaj she does n't know how to command the screen except by wearing a tight , low cut top . xxmaj she imitates xxmaj allen in a couple of scenes , and that just looks weird and sad . \n"," \n","  xxmaj it does n't help that her character is scripted as a doll who ca n't function without a ghost , or an elderly and less than awe - inspiring magician , telling her what to do at every turn . \n"," \n","  xxmaj she is approximately half xxmaj jackman 's age , and she comes across as a very vapid screen presence in their scenes together . \n"," \n","  xxmaj audience members not obsessed with breasts deserve better in their heroines , and xxmaj jackman deserves better , too -- a script that gives the heroine some intelligence and agency , and an actress who can convey those qualities . \n"," \n","  xxmaj hugh xxmaj jackman is similarly cheated by the script . xxmaj allen apparently ca n't stand it that xxmaj jackman is so stunningly good looking and young , and so he gives xxmaj jackman nothing to say or do . xxmaj like xxmaj johansson , he is used merely for his good looks . xxmaj this is a shame , because , as xxmaj jackman has shown in any number of productions , from \" xxmaj oklahoma \" to \" x xxmaj men , \" he xxup can act . \n"," \n","  xxmaj here 's the big plot twist -- xxmaj jackman , suave , charming xxmaj english xxmaj lord , really is a killer . xxmaj so , though the movie says it is all about letting someone else , other than xxmaj allen , get the girl , she does n't get anyone . xxmaj jackman , the man she 's been making love to , is a man who murdered a prostitute . xxmaj nice , xxmaj woody . xxmaj nice way to punish your heroine for being beyond your grasp . \n"," \n","  xxmaj in a passive aggressive touch , xxmaj allen deprives his heroine of his own presence , as well , killing off his character , the magician , leaving xxmaj scarlett xxmaj johansson all alone at the end of the film . \n"," \n","  a final note : at my screening , not a single audience member laughed at any point during the film . xxmaj always a bad sign when a film is advertised as a comedy .,xxbos xxmaj who ? xxmaj what ? xxmaj where ? xxmaj when ? xxmaj why ? xxmaj the acting was terrible . xxmaj very robotic , rehearsed . i have seen all of the actors in this film in better roles . xxmaj the screenplay was very elementary . xxmaj by the end of this film , the story line was tied up . xxmaj and xxmaj jeane xxmaj claude xxunk should be tied up , too . xxmaj so that he never attempts to write / direct another film .\n","y: LMLabelList\n",",,,,\n","Path: /root/.fastai/data/imdb;\n","\n","Valid: LabelList (10000 items)\n","x:

.,xxbos xxmaj do n't watch this movie expecting the xxmaj jane xxmaj austen wit , crisp dialog or clever social commentary . xxmaj this time around , the premise of xxmaj northanger xxmaj abbey has been updated in a very sensual way ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj in this version , xxmaj catherine 's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies , but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures . xxmaj by day she is very prim and demure , and her swain xxmaj henry treats her with the utmost courtesy . xxmaj but as her own sexual nature awakens , her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj at the beginning of the story , xxmaj catherine 's visions of sex are based entirely on the xxmaj gothic novels she devours in bed . xxmaj it is both heartwarming , sexy , and provocative to observe the way her dreamy picture of handsome xxmaj henry \" dissolves \" into a lurid dream of being carried off and ravished by romantic villains ! xxmaj at the same time , it is wry and touching to cut back to her bed in the morning -- xxmaj catherine sleeping peacefully looks so innocent one would never guess what really goes on in that pretty little head ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj later , after being invited to xxmaj henry 's castle , xxmaj catherine overhears a family argument and totally misunderstands its meaning . xxmaj jumping into bed , she covers herself up with the bedsheets and lies awake listening fearfully , her striking blue eyes the only visible sign that she is alert . xxmaj little by little , however , those pretty blue eyes xxunk and close as she drifts into another heated dream of innocent desire . xxmaj this time , xxmaj catherine dreams she is in xxmaj elizabethan times , waiting fearfully outside the castle for the approach of the \" xxunk ! \" xxmaj it 's pretty clear she is more excited than terrified by the idea of being carried off by bandits . xxmaj she all but shudders with excitement and anticipation ! xxmaj but then , after a shot of her running frantically to escape , we are back to the daylight world , where the maid is scolding her for having made a mess of her room before falling into a sound sleep . xxmaj it 's worth noting that xxmaj catherine 's heavy - eyed yawning in the morning light is itself a rather sensual symbol of how passionate her dreams have been ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj ultimately , of course , xxmaj catherine 's stern and unimaginative lover xxmaj henry xxunk the nature of her fantasies and gives her a stern lecture . xxmaj it 's interesting that xxmaj catherine 's immediate collapse into tears symbolizes not a retreat but an advance into adult relationships . xxmaj in the next scene , she tearfully burns her xxmaj gothic romance and throws herself xxunk and sobbing onto the bed . xxmaj significantly , this turning point is also marked by xxmaj catherine falling into a deep sleep -- except that this time , there are no dreams of make believe passion . xxmaj presumably , xxmaj catherine has matured enough to be ready for the real thing . \n"," \n","  xxmaj though xxmaj katherine xxmaj schlesinger has lovely blue eyes and a lively expression , and all her performance is charming , it must be said that outside of the heated dream sequences this movie adaptation is excruciatingly dull . i 'm giving it 9 stars only because the truly romantic may enjoy it purely on a daydream level . \n"," \n","  xxmaj if you 'd like to read a book about a genuinely strong willed young heroine who overcomes real darkness and

now , he has no real purpose ) . xxmaj the ending is needlessly fluffy , and the only thing different between this and other crappy new episodes ( ' xxunk ) is that the kids can interact with adults .

gives xxmaj jackman nothing to say or do . xxmaj like xxmaj johansson , he is used merely for his good looks . xxmaj this is a shame , because , as xxmaj jackman has shown in any number of productions , from \" xxmaj oklahoma \" to \" x xxmaj men , \" he xxup can act . \n"," \n","  xxmaj here 's the big plot twist -- xxmaj jackman , suave , charming xxmaj english xxmaj lord , really is a killer . xxmaj so , though the movie says it is all about letting someone else , other than xxmaj allen , get the girl , she does n't get anyone . xxmaj jackman , the man she 's been making love to , is a man who murdered a prostitute . xxmaj nice , xxmaj woody . xxmaj nice way to punish your heroine for being beyond your grasp . \n"," \n","  xxmaj in a passive aggressive touch , xxmaj allen deprives his

came from me seeing this movie : i doubly admire xxup lost xxup in xxup translation now .,xxbos xxmaj do n't watch this movie expecting the xxmaj jane xxmaj austen wit , crisp dialog or clever social commentary . xxmaj this time around , the premise of xxmaj northanger xxmaj abbey has been updated in a very sensual way ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj in this version , xxmaj catherine 's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies , but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures . xxmaj by day she is very prim and demure , and her swain xxmaj henry treats her with the utmost courtesy . xxmaj but as her own sexual nature awakens , her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj at the beginning of the story , xxmaj catherine 's visions of sex are based entirely on the xxmaj gothic novels she devours in bed . xxmaj it is both heartwarming , sexy , and provocative to observe the way her dreamy picture of handsome xxmaj henry \" dissolves \" into a lurid dream of being carried off and ravished by romantic villains ! xxmaj at the same time , it is wry and touching to cut back to her bed in the morning -- xxmaj catherine sleeping peacefully looks so innocent one would never guess what really goes on in that pretty little head ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj later , after being invited to xxmaj henry 's castle , xxmaj catherine overhears a family argument and totally misunderstands its meaning . xxmaj jumping into bed , she covers herself up with the bedsheets and lies awake listening fearfully , her striking blue eyes the only visible sign that she is alert . xxmaj little by little , however , those pretty blue eyes xxunk and close as she drifts into another heated dream of innocent desire . xxmaj this time , xxmaj catherine dreams she is in xxmaj elizabethan times , waiting fearfully outside the castle for the approach of the \" xxunk ! \" xxmaj it 's pretty clear she is more excited than terrified by the idea of being carried off by bandits . xxmaj she all but shudders with excitement and anticipation ! xxmaj but then , after a shot of her running frantically to escape , we are back to the daylight world , where the maid is scolding her for having made a mess of her room before falling into a sound sleep . xxmaj it 's worth noting that xxmaj catherine 's heavy - eyed yawning in the morning light is itself a rather sensual symbol of how passionate her dreams have been ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj ultimately , of course , xxmaj catherine 's stern and unimaginative lover xxmaj henry xxunk the nature of her fantasies and gives her a stern lecture . xxmaj it 's interesting that xxmaj catherine 's immediate collapse into tears symbolizes not a retreat but an advance into adult relationships . xxmaj in the next scene , she tearfully burns her xxmaj gothic romance and throws herself xxunk and sobbing onto the bed . xxmaj significantly , this turning point is also marked by xxmaj catherine falling into a deep sleep -- except that this time , there are no dreams of make believe passion . xxmaj presumably , xxmaj catherine has matured enough to be ready for the real thing . \n"," \n","  xxmaj though xxmaj katherine xxmaj schlesinger has lovely blue eyes and a lively expression , and all her performance is charming , it must be said that outside of the heated dream sequences this movie adaptation is excruciatingly dull . i 'm giving it 9 stars only because the truly romantic may enjoy it purely on a daydream level . \n"," \n","  xxmaj if you 'd like to read a book about a genuinely strong willed young heroine who overcomes real darkness and danger in a real xxmaj gothic setting , i highly recommend xxup the xxup perilous xxup gard by xxmaj elizabeth xxmaj marie xxmaj pope .,xxbos xxmaj since \" xxmaj rugrats \" ' falling from the category of good and funny cartoon series to a mediocre and indeed outright horrible fare for two year olds in the past three or four years , obviously the tyrants at xxmaj klasky - xxmaj csupo should be out of ideas . xxmaj after dumbing down all of the characters , adding even stupider new ones , replacing some voices ( though i like xxmaj nancy xxmaj cartwright , she is xxup not xxmaj chucky xxmaj finster ! ) , and having no sense of continuity ( ex . : in a xxmaj kimi episode i watched the other day , xxmaj tommy and xxmaj chucky each got a new puppy ; but it subsequent episode , the aforementioned dogs never appear ) , you 'd think the creators could kill the show for mercy . xxmaj but n xxrep 4 o

grandpa ( my xxmaj god ! xxmaj he used to be the best character on the show , but now , he has no real purpose ) . xxmaj the ending is needlessly fluffy , and the only thing different between this and other crappy new episodes ( ' xxunk ) is that the kids can interact with adults . xxmaj whoa , what fun ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj no stars at all for \" xxmaj the xxmaj rugrats xxmaj all xxmaj growed xxmaj

movie and the xxmaj matrix spin off scene , basically recreated the scene without much humor injected into it . \n"," \n","  xxmaj today 's youth might not be able to relate to the spoof gags of the classic supernatural horror films of the 70 's such as the xxmaj exorcist and maybe of the 80s ' xxmaj poltergeist , et . al . \n"," \n","  xxmaj hopefully xxmaj scary xxmaj movie 3 will take some time to put together , making the spoofs more enjoyable . \n"," \n","  xxmaj one thing though , the film features more than the last one of promising young actress xxmaj anna xxmaj faris ( whom i will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel ) . xxmaj just for her casting and acting ability , i give this movie a \" 3 \" out of \" 10 \" .,xxbos this is the first time i 'm writing a comment on a movie on imdb . but i had to write it for this one . its 3 hrs of unadulterated torture . from the starting u get the idea that the movie is gon na be bad . the acting is pathetic . i 'm a big fan of xxmaj ajay devgan ( loved him in bhagat singh ) but he is at his worst in this movie . amitabh seems to have worked hard for this one , but somehow the fear is missing . prashant raj is a non actor . and the most irritating part of the movie is nisha kothari . i have no clue why the director took her in this movie . the background score is repetitive . somehow i felt that ramu tried to repeat a sarkar , the color theme , the background score , the camera angles , but it did n't work . xxup please xxmaj do n't xxup watch xxup it,xxbos xxmaj despite having known people who are either great fans of xxmaj noam xxmaj chomsky , or think he 's a tired relic from the 1960s , i really had no opinion of the man , save that i knew he gained fame as a linguist , although i could not elucidate any of his theories , and that he was a liberal socialist with xxmaj marxist leanings . xxmaj so , stumbling across the xxup dvd of the 2003 documentary xxmaj noam xxmaj chomsky : xxmaj rebel xxmaj without a xxmaj pause , in a used video store , a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 9 - 11 , i decided to get it , just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person , pro or con , spoke of him . xxmaj while glad i got the film , my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was , so what 's all the fuss about ? \n"," \n","  xxmaj for a man with so many degrees , lauded as ' the most important intellectual alive ' , by the xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj times , according to the xxup dvd 's case , there sure was not a lot there , intellectually speaking . i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate , and i would n't even want to watch what a xxmaj william xxup f. xxmaj buckley could do to him . xxmaj granted , the whole film was seemingly about xxmaj chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere , and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he 'd say , rather than being on linguistics , so maybe that 's the reason he came off so badly . xxmaj but , again , if he is a linguist , and tops in his field , why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise ? \n"," . xxmaj even worse are his acolytes , who seem to further xxunk the man from reality , by fostering delusions that xxmaj chomsky is a target for xxmaj zionist assassins . xxmaj what little i knew of xxmaj chomsky before watching this film , this much i knew : he was generally considered a has been , and pretty much irrelevant intellectually , since the fall of the xxmaj soviet xxmaj empire . xxmaj the film is so poorly structured , and without a narrative thread , that it 's difficult to separate all of the jumble . xxmaj his wife , xxmaj carol , as example , apparently gave one interview , which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film . xxmaj she seems a nice enough woman , but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life . xxmaj the lone interesting thing she says is that 9 / 11 was a great thing for the xxmaj xxunk , for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then . \n"," \n","  xxmaj not surprisingly , this sort of film gives almost no biographical background . xxmaj it 's assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this ' great man ' bears . xxmaj chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one . xxmaj stylistically , there are no camera movements , no interesting edits , nor any signature touches , and most of the film is xxunk rambles by xxmaj chomsky , videotaped xxunk of xxmaj chomsky declaiming on this or that , and slack - jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial , that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him . xxmaj this is really poor film - making by director and editor xxmaj will xxmaj pascoe , who in the xxup dvd 's xxmaj filmmaker xxmaj statement , shows he 's yet another uncritical acolyte of xxmaj chomsky 's . xxmaj other than that , one of the xxunk signs that this is not an objective documentary , but mere agitprop , and a vanity piece of agitprop , at that , is that not a single time is xxmaj chomsky shown struggling with an answer . xxmaj he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds . \n"," \n","  xxmaj given that much of this dreck was filmed during xxmaj chomsky 's lectures at mcmaster xxmaj university , in xxmaj ontario , xxmaj canada , prior to the xxmaj american invasion of xxmaj iraq in 2003 , much of what xxmaj chomsky says seems as remote as things from the xxmaj vietnam xxmaj war era . xxmaj yes , he makes some good points , here and there , on xxmaj american media complicity before the war , but he follows them up with sheer lunacy , for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc , and not fully plotted out xxunk . xxmaj as example , he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace , but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled . xxmaj similarly , he claims xxmaj xxunk run the world and that people 's fear of crime is yet another cabal 's result . xxmaj of course , that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers , and all that wasted time and money district attorneys ' offices consume . xxmaj he also makes the absurd claim that xxmaj cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades , when xxmaj castro and company were great sponsors of it , in xxmaj latin xxmaj america , xxmaj asia , and xxmaj africa , until the xxmaj soviet xxmaj union fell . i can only guess that the xxup ufo xxunk are just waiting for xxmaj chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species - mixing impregnation centers up in xxmaj idaho . \n"," \n","  xxmaj in his simpleminded world without grays , xxmaj chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of xxmaj xxunk , whom he reviles , are ; even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals . xxmaj in short , xxmaj chomsky is a man living in the past , in over his head on most issues , and out of his depth intellectually . xxmaj near this film 's end he warns , ' xxmaj be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice , ' yet one can only laugh , as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he did n't like , no matter how barbarous their crimes , and anti - intellectual their posit . xxmaj please , pause before you waste your

/root/.fastai/data/imdb;\n","\n","Valid: LabelList (10000 items)\n","x: LMTextList\n","xxbos xxmaj anemic comedy - drama , an unhappy , seemingly rushed affair featuring xxmaj cher as a woebegone housewife who slowly makes friends with the hit - man who 's been hired to kill her by her husband . xxmaj chazz xxmaj palminteri , as the talkative hired gun , adapted the screenplay from his own play , with stagy set - ups and back - and - forth dialogue that quickly tires the eye and ear . xxmaj an air of gloom hangs over the entire project , and director xxmaj paul xxmaj mazursky ca n't get xxmaj cher out of her perpetual funk ( she 's listless ) . xxmaj despite all the top talent ( including xxmaj robert xxmaj de xxmaj niro as one of the producers ) , \" xxmaj faithful \" is fraudulent , with no substance to the story and characters who rarely come to life . * 1 / 2 from xxrep 4 *,xxbos xxmaj this movie was so heart warming . a true testament to an actors real life everyday ups and downs . xxmaj it was truly a wonderful experience to share the passion of the actor on film and respect for what it must have taken off screen . xxmaj this film is a reminder to everyone to go for there xxunk give xxunk for xxmaj the xxmaj stand -in ! ! !,xxbos xxup stranger xxup than xxup fiction angered me so much , i signed up on imdb just to write this review . xxup stranger xxup than xxup fiction is a surprisingly complex , touching and thought - provoking movie until the very end . xxmaj once you suspend multiple lapses of logic ( why did n't xxmaj will xxmaj ferrell hear xxmaj emma xxmaj thompson 's voice 10 years ago when she fist started writing her book ? \" xxmaj the phone rang . xxmaj the phone rang again . \" xxmaj how could she not know it 's him calling ? etc . ) , the movie challenges one 's thoughts about mortality , fate , and sacrifice . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the brief history of literary themes provided by xxmaj dustin xxmaj hoffman should especially entertain former xxmaj english majors . xxmaj and xxmaj maggie xxmaj gyllenhaal is always a pleasure , even though xxmaj will xxmaj ferrell might just as easily be an ax murderer as a bumbling soul . xxmaj her quick trust of him is a mighty big leap of faith . \n"," \n","  xxmaj ah , but the ending . xxmaj until the very end , i would have given 9 out of 10 stars to this movie . xxmaj the movie as a metaphor for life 's journey , as a tribute to the notion of ' writing true , ' as a reminder that great literature is either comedy or tragedy , but not both , is outstanding . xxmaj the entire movie leads the viewer to understand and accept the moment of xxmaj will xxmaj ferrell 's fate . xxmaj and no matter how endearing a character he may have become , we know full well why we will accept the ending . xxmaj the last act occurs , the screen goes white , the credits roll . a profound and powerful end to an almost perfect film . xxmaj an end that would have been debated for weeks . \n"," \n","  xxup no xxrep 10 ! xxmaj no credits rolled . xxmaj say it is n't so . xxmaj say xxmaj hollywood did n't tack on another 10 minutes of crap that completely undermined the integrity and heart of the movie . xxmaj dustin xxmaj hoffman got it right when he said , \" xxmaj it 's no longer a masterpiece ; it 's xxup ok . \" xxmaj an apt review of the movie . xxmaj except to me , it was n't even xxup ok . i was so offended about the betrayal of ' writing true , ' about the decision to pander the film that i actually burst into angry tears explaining this on the ride home from the movie . i do n't often cry . i could care less about most movies , but i am still angry about this one . \n"," \n","  xxmaj my questions for xxmaj zack xxmaj helm , the writer , are this : did the original movie end when the screen went white ? xxmaj and were you forced by the vapid movie powers - that - be to tack on an ending unfaithful to the core of the movie ? xxmaj or did you tack that maudlin ending on yourself ? i 've read you 're brilliant . i hope your original script ended the movie the first time . \n"," \n","  i know xxmaj zack xxmaj helm will never see this review , and i 've been unable to find a contact for him to ask myself . xxmaj but , please , movie - goers , am i the only one who feels this way about xxup stranger xxup than xxup fiction ? xxmaj one good thing came from me seeing this movie : i doubly admire xxup lost xxup in xxup translation now .,xxbos xxmaj do n't watch this movie expecting the xxmaj jane xxmaj austen wit , crisp dialog or clever social commentary . xxmaj this time around , the premise of xxmaj northanger xxmaj abbey has been updated in a very sensual way ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj in this version , xxmaj catherine 's erotic daydreams are not just silly fantasies , but a connection to the world of adult sexuality she is just peeking into with her daylight adventures . xxmaj by day she is very prim and demure , and her swain xxmaj henry treats her with the utmost courtesy . xxmaj but as her own sexual nature awakens , her daydreams shift every so subtly from mild to steamy to lurid ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj at the beginning of the story , xxmaj catherine 's visions of sex are based entirely on the xxmaj gothic novels she devours in bed . xxmaj it is both heartwarming , sexy , and provocative to observe the way her dreamy picture of handsome xxmaj henry \" dissolves \" into a lurid dream of being carried off and ravished by romantic villains ! xxmaj at the same time , it is wry and touching to cut back to her bed in the morning -- xxmaj catherine sleeping peacefully looks so innocent one would never guess what really goes on in that pretty little head ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj later , after being invited to xxmaj henry 's castle , xxmaj catherine overhears a family argument and totally misunderstands its meaning . xxmaj jumping into bed , she covers herself up with the bedsheets and lies awake listening fearfully , her striking blue eyes the only visible sign that she is alert . xxmaj little by little , however , those pretty blue eyes xxunk and close as she drifts into another heated dream of innocent desire . xxmaj this time , xxmaj catherine dreams she is in xxmaj elizabethan times , waiting fearfully outside the castle for the approach of the \" xxunk ! \" xxmaj it 's pretty clear she is more excited than terrified by the idea of being carried off by bandits . xxmaj she all but shudders with excitement and anticipation ! xxmaj but then , after a shot of her running frantically to escape , we are back to the daylight world , where the maid is scolding her for having made a mess of her room before falling into a sound sleep . xxmaj it 's worth noting that xxmaj catherine 's heavy - eyed yawning in the morning light is itself a rather sensual symbol of how passionate her dreams have been ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj ultimately , of course , xxmaj catherine 's stern and unimaginative lover xxmaj henry xxunk the nature of her fantasies and gives her a stern lecture . xxmaj it 's interesting that xxmaj catherine 's immediate collapse into tears symbolizes not a retreat but an advance into adult relationships . xxmaj in the next scene , she tearfully burns her xxmaj gothic romance and throws herself xxunk and sobbing onto the bed . xxmaj significantly , this turning point is also marked by xxmaj catherine falling into a deep sleep -- except that this time , there are no dreams of make believe passion . xxmaj presumably , xxmaj catherine has matured enough to be ready for the real thing . \n"," \n","  xxmaj though xxmaj katherine xxmaj schlesinger has lovely blue eyes and a lively expression , and all her performance is charming , it must be said that outside of the heated dream sequences this movie adaptation is excruciatingly dull . i 'm giving it 9 stars only because the truly romantic may enjoy it purely on a daydream level . \n"," \n","  xxmaj if you 'd like to read a book about a genuinely strong willed young heroine who overcomes real darkness and danger in a real xxmaj gothic setting , i highly recommend xxup the xxup perilous xxup gard by xxmaj elizabeth xxmaj marie xxmaj pope .,xxbos xxmaj since \" xxmaj rugrats \" ' falling from the category of good and funny cartoon series to a mediocre and indeed outright horrible fare for two year olds in the past three or four years , obviously the tyrants at xxmaj klasky - xxmaj csupo should be out of ideas . xxmaj after dumbing down all of the characters , adding even stupider new ones , replacing some voices ( though i like xxmaj nancy xxmaj cartwright , she is xxup not xxmaj chucky xxmaj finster ! ) , and having no sense of continuity ( ex . : in a xxmaj kimi episode i watched the other day , xxmaj tommy and xxmaj chucky each got a new puppy ; but it subsequent episode , the aforementioned dogs never appear ) , you 'd think the creators could kill the show for mercy . xxmaj but n xxrep 4 o . \n"," \n","  xxmaj all i will say concerning this special is that it sucks ! xxmaj while not as horrible as the xxmaj kimi episodes , everyone is even stupider than they were , including xxmaj grandpa ( my xxmaj god ! xxmaj he used to be the best character on the show , but now , he has no real purpose ) . xxmaj the ending is needlessly fluffy , and the only thing different between this and other crappy new episodes ( ' xxunk ) is that the kids can interact with adults . xxmaj whoa , what fun ! \n"," \n","  xxmaj no stars at all for \" xxmaj the xxmaj rugrats xxmaj all xxmaj growed xxmaj up \" . xxmaj klasky - xxmaj csupo , please xxup destroy this show before it gets any worse .\n","y: LMLabelList\n",",,,,\n","Path: /root/.fastai/data/imdb;\n","\n","Test: None, model=SequentialRNN(\n","  (0):

LabelList (25000 items)\n","x: TextList\n","xxbos xxmaj given that this movie was put together in less than a year might explain its shortness ( 81 minutes - including end credits , so roughly 76 minutes of actual film ) . xxmaj but what it can not explain is its lack of humor that the previous film possessed . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the gags are quick and sometimes not even funny . xxmaj the only true funny parts are the quick spoofs on the xxmaj nike basketball spots , xxmaj james xxmaj woods ' portrayal of xxmaj max xxmaj van xxmaj sydow 's character in the xxmaj exorcist , and bits and pieces scattered throughout the film . xxmaj very unfunny was the take off of xxmaj charlie 's xxmaj angels , which like the first xxmaj scary xxmaj movie and the xxmaj matrix spin off scene , basically recreated the scene without much humor injected into it . \n"," \n","  xxmaj today 's youth might not be able to relate to the spoof gags of the classic supernatural horror films of the 70 's such as the xxmaj exorcist and maybe of the 80s ' xxmaj poltergeist , et . al . \n"," \n","  xxmaj hopefully xxmaj scary xxmaj movie 3 will take some time to put together , making the spoofs more enjoyable . \n"," \n","  xxmaj one thing though , the film features more than the last one of promising young actress xxmaj anna xxmaj faris ( whom i will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel ) . xxmaj just for her casting and acting ability , i give this movie a \" 3 \" out of \" 10 \" .,xxbos this is the first time i 'm writing a comment on a movie on imdb . but i had to write it for this one . its 3 hrs of unadulterated torture . from the starting u get the idea that the movie is gon na be bad . the acting is pathetic . i 'm a big fan of xxmaj ajay devgan ( loved him in bhagat singh ) but he is at his worst in this movie . amitabh seems to have worked hard for this one , but somehow the fear is missing . prashant raj is a non actor . and the most irritating part of the movie is nisha kothari . i have no clue why the director took her in this movie . the background score is repetitive . somehow i felt that ramu tried to repeat a sarkar , the color theme , the background score , the camera angles , but it did n't work . xxup please xxmaj do n't xxup watch xxup it,xxbos xxmaj despite having known people who are either great fans of xxmaj noam xxmaj chomsky , or think he 's a tired relic from the 1960s , i really had no opinion of the man , save that i knew he gained fame as a linguist , although i could not elucidate any of his theories , and that he was a liberal socialist with xxmaj marxist leanings . xxmaj so , stumbling across the xxup dvd of the 2003 documentary xxmaj noam xxmaj chomsky : xxmaj rebel xxmaj without a xxmaj pause , in a used video store , a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 9 - 11 , i decided to get it , just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person , pro or con , spoke of him . xxmaj while glad i got the film , my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was , so what 's all the fuss about ? \n"," \n","  xxmaj for a man with so many degrees , lauded as ' the most important intellectual alive ' , by the xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj times , according to the xxup dvd 's case , there sure was not a lot there , intellectually speaking . i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate , and i would n't even want to watch what a xxmaj william xxup f. xxmaj buckley could do to him . xxmaj granted , the whole film was seemingly about xxmaj chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere , and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he 'd say , rather than being on linguistics , so maybe that 's the reason he came off so badly . xxmaj but , again , if he is a linguist , and tops in his field , why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise ? \n"," . xxmaj even worse are his acolytes , who seem to further xxunk the man from reality , by fostering delusions that xxmaj chomsky is a target for xxmaj zionist assassins . xxmaj what little i knew of xxmaj chomsky before watching this film , this much i knew : he was generally considered a has been , and pretty much irrelevant intellectually , since the fall of the xxmaj soviet xxmaj empire . xxmaj the film is so poorly structured , and without a narrative thread , that it 's difficult to separate all of the jumble . xxmaj his wife , xxmaj carol , as example , apparently gave one interview , which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film . xxmaj she seems a nice enough woman , but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life . xxmaj the lone interesting thing she says is that 9 / 11 was a great thing for the xxmaj xxunk , for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then . \n"," \n","  xxmaj not surprisingly , this sort of film gives almost no biographical background . xxmaj it 's assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this ' great man ' bears . xxmaj chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one . xxmaj stylistically , there are no camera movements , no interesting edits , nor any signature touches , and most of the film is xxunk rambles by xxmaj chomsky , videotaped xxunk of xxmaj chomsky declaiming on this or that , and slack - jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial , that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him . xxmaj this is really poor film - making by director and editor xxmaj will xxmaj pascoe , who in the xxup dvd 's xxmaj filmmaker xxmaj statement , shows he 's yet another uncritical acolyte of xxmaj chomsky 's . xxmaj other than that , one of the xxunk signs that this is not an objective documentary , but mere agitprop , and a vanity piece of agitprop , at that , is that not a single time is xxmaj chomsky shown struggling with an answer . xxmaj he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds . \n"," \n","  xxmaj given that much of this dreck was filmed during xxmaj chomsky 's lectures at mcmaster xxmaj university , in xxmaj ontario , xxmaj canada , prior to the xxmaj american invasion of xxmaj iraq in 2003 , much of what xxmaj chomsky says seems as remote as things from the xxmaj vietnam xxmaj war era . xxmaj yes , he makes some good points , here and there , on xxmaj american media complicity before the war , but he follows them up with sheer lunacy , for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc , and not fully plotted out xxunk . xxmaj as example , he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace , but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled . xxmaj similarly , he claims xxmaj xxunk run the world and that people 's fear of crime is yet another cabal 's result . xxmaj of course , that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers , and all that wasted time and money district attorneys ' offices consume . xxmaj he also makes the absurd claim that xxmaj cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades , when xxmaj castro and company were great sponsors of it , in xxmaj latin xxmaj america , xxmaj asia , and xxmaj africa , until the xxmaj soviet xxmaj union fell . i can only guess that the xxup ufo xxunk are just waiting for xxmaj chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species - mixing impregnation centers up in xxmaj idaho . \n"," \n","  xxmaj in his simpleminded world without grays , xxmaj chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of xxmaj xxunk , whom he reviles , are ; even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals . xxmaj in short , xxmaj chomsky is a man living in the past , in over his head on most issues , and out of his depth intellectually . xxmaj near this film 's end he warns , ' xxmaj be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice , ' yet one can only laugh , as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he did n't like , no matter how barbarous their crimes , and anti - intellectual their posit . xxmaj please , pause before you waste your time and money on this silly , and already irrelevant , xxup dvd .,xxbos xxup warning ! xxmaj this review will reveal the ending of the movie , \" xxmaj scoop . \" xxmaj if you do n't want to know how the movie ends , do n't read this review ! \n"," \n","  \" xxmaj scoop \" is so bad you 'll think \" xxmaj annie xxmaj hall \" was a fluke . \n"," \n","  xxmaj it gets one star because you get to see xxmaj hugh xxmaj jackman 's naked chest . xxmaj that 's the only thing \" xxmaj scoop \" has going for it . \n"," \n","  xxmaj woody xxmaj allen 's misogyny , and his fixation on women young enough , at this point , to be his granddaughter , has crippled any ability to make movies he may have had at any point . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the plot seems promising : a ghost , xxmaj ian mcshane , directs a fluffy headed student , xxmaj scarlett xxmaj johansson , to investigate whether or not an xxmaj english xxmaj lord , xxmaj hugh xxmaj jackman , is the notorious xxmaj tarot xxmaj card xxmaj killer of prostitutes . a magician , xxmaj woody xxmaj allen , helps the girl . \n"," \n","  xxmaj promising plot notwithstanding , the movie completely lacks charm , or humor , or atmosphere . xxmaj it 's an amazingly leaden , amateurish effort for someone who has made even one previous film , never mind dozens . xxmaj perhaps xxmaj allen has had a stroke that has gone unreported in the press . \n"," \n","  xxmaj much is made of the fact that unlike in his previous films , xxmaj woody xxmaj allen , now a xxunk , has xxup finally allowed a younger male lead to get the girl . \n"," \n","  xxmaj not so . xxmaj in fact , the plot is constructed in such a way so that the girl gets no one . \n"," \n","  xxmaj there is an early scene where xxmaj johansson , for no reason central to the movie , allows herself to be gotten drunk , and seduced , by a powerful , older director . \" xxmaj seduced \" is a euphemism for what happens . xxmaj it 's a \" slam , bam , i 've got ta go \" kind of moment . xxmaj it bears no relation to the plot whatsoever , and it cheapens xxmaj johansson in the viewer 's eye . xxmaj why did xxmaj allen add that unnecessary scene to the movie ? xxmaj because it shows a powerful director - like xxmaj allen - having sex with the female lead . xxmaj allen gets to have his cake and eat it , too . \n"," \n","  xxmaj johansson is not yet an actress . xxmaj she does n't know how to command the screen except by wearing a tight , low cut top . xxmaj she imitates xxmaj allen in a couple of scenes , and that just looks weird and sad . \n"," \n","  xxmaj it does n't help that her character is scripted as a doll who ca n't function without a ghost , or an elderly and less than awe - inspiring magician , telling her what to do at every turn . \n"," \n","  xxmaj she is approximately half xxmaj jackman 's age , and she comes across as a very vapid screen presence in their scenes together . \n"," \n","  xxmaj audience members not obsessed with breasts deserve better in their heroines , and xxmaj jackman deserves better , too -- a script that gives the heroine some intelligence and agency , and an actress who can convey those qualities . \n"," \n","  xxmaj hugh xxmaj jackman is similarly cheated by the script . xxmaj allen apparently ca n't stand it that xxmaj jackman is so stunningly good looking and young , and so he gives xxmaj jackman nothing to say or do . xxmaj like xxmaj johansson , he is used

11 , i decided to get it , just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person , pro or con , spoke of him . xxmaj while glad i got the film , my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was , so what 's all the fuss about ? \n"," \n","  xxmaj for a man with so many degrees , lauded as ' the most important intellectual alive ' , by the xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj times , according to the xxup dvd 's case , there sure was not a lot there , intellectually speaking . i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate , and i would n't even want to watch what a xxmaj william xxup f. xxmaj buckley could do to him . xxmaj granted , the whole film was seemingly about xxmaj chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere , and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he 'd say , rather than being on linguistics , so maybe that 's the reason he came off so badly . xxmaj but , again , if he is a linguist , and tops in his field , why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise ? \n"," . xxmaj even worse are his acolytes , who seem to further xxunk the man from reality , by fostering delusions that xxmaj chomsky is a target for xxmaj zionist assassins . xxmaj what little i knew of xxmaj chomsky before watching this film , this much i knew : he was generally considered a has been , and pretty much irrelevant intellectually , since the fall of the xxmaj soviet xxmaj empire . xxmaj the film is so poorly structured , and without a narrative thread , that it 's difficult to separate all of the jumble . xxmaj his wife , xxmaj carol , as example , apparently gave one interview , which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film . xxmaj she seems a nice enough woman , but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life . xxmaj the lone interesting thing she says is that 9 / 11 was a great thing for the xxmaj xxunk , for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then . \n"," \n","  xxmaj not surprisingly , this sort of film gives almost no biographical background . xxmaj it 's assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this ' great man ' bears . xxmaj chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one . xxmaj stylistically , there are no camera movements , no interesting edits , nor any signature touches , and most of the film is xxunk rambles by xxmaj chomsky , videotaped xxunk of xxmaj chomsky declaiming on this or that , and slack - jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial , that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him . xxmaj this is really poor film - making by director and editor xxmaj will xxmaj pascoe , who in the xxup dvd 's xxmaj filmmaker xxmaj statement , shows he 's yet another uncritical acolyte of xxmaj chomsky 's . xxmaj other than that , one of the xxunk signs that this is not an objective documentary , but mere agitprop , and a vanity piece of agitprop , at that , is that not a single time is xxmaj chomsky shown struggling with an answer . xxmaj he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds . \n"," \n","  xxmaj given that much of this dreck was filmed during xxmaj chomsky 's lectures at mcmaster xxmaj university , in xxmaj ontario , xxmaj canada , prior to the xxmaj american invasion of xxmaj iraq in 2003 , much of what xxmaj chomsky says seems as remote as things from the xxmaj vietnam xxmaj war era . xxmaj yes , he makes some good points , here and there , on xxmaj american media complicity before the war , but he follows them up with sheer lunacy , for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc , and not fully plotted out xxunk . xxmaj as example , he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace , but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled . xxmaj similarly , he claims xxmaj xxunk run the world and that people 's fear of crime is yet another cabal 's result . xxmaj of course , that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers , and all that wasted time and money district attorneys ' offices consume . xxmaj he also makes the absurd claim that xxmaj cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades , when xxmaj castro and company were great sponsors of it , in xxmaj latin xxmaj america , xxmaj asia , and xxmaj africa , until the xxmaj soviet xxmaj union fell . i can only guess that the xxup ufo xxunk are just waiting for xxmaj chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species - mixing impregnation centers up in xxmaj idaho . \n"," \n","  xxmaj in his simpleminded world without grays , xxmaj chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of xxmaj xxunk , whom he reviles , are ; even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals . xxmaj in short , xxmaj chomsky is a man living in the past , in over his head on most issues , and out of his depth intellectually . xxmaj near this film 's end he warns , ' xxmaj be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice , ' yet one can only laugh , as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he did n't like , no matter how barbarous their crimes , and anti -

11 , i decided to get it , just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person , pro or con , spoke of him . xxmaj while glad i got the film , my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was , so what 's all the fuss about ? \n"," \n","  xxmaj for a man with so many degrees , lauded as ' the most important intellectual alive ' , by the xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj times , according to the xxup dvd 's case , there sure was not a lot there , intellectually speaking . i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate , and i would n't even want to watch what a xxmaj william xxup f. xxmaj buckley could do to him . xxmaj granted , the whole film was seemingly about xxmaj chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere , and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he 'd say , rather than being on linguistics , so maybe that 's the reason he came off so badly . xxmaj but , again , if he is a linguist , and tops in his field , why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise ? \n"," . xxmaj even worse are his acolytes , who seem to further xxunk the man from reality , by fostering delusions that xxmaj chomsky is a target for xxmaj zionist assassins . xxmaj what little i knew of xxmaj chomsky before watching this film , this much i knew : he was generally considered a has been , and pretty much irrelevant intellectually , since the fall of the xxmaj soviet xxmaj empire . xxmaj the film is so poorly structured , and without a narrative thread , that it 's difficult to separate all of the jumble . xxmaj his wife , xxmaj carol , as example , apparently gave one interview , which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film . xxmaj she seems a nice enough woman , but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life . xxmaj the lone interesting thing she says is that 9 / 11 was a great thing for the xxmaj xxunk , for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then . \n"," \n","  xxmaj not surprisingly , this sort of film gives almost no biographical background . xxmaj it 's assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this ' great man ' bears . xxmaj chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one . xxmaj stylistically , there are no camera movements , no interesting edits , nor any signature touches , and most of the film is xxunk rambles by xxmaj chomsky , videotaped xxunk of xxmaj chomsky declaiming on this or that , and slack - jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial , that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him . xxmaj this is really poor film - making by director and editor xxmaj will xxmaj pascoe , who in the xxup dvd 's xxmaj filmmaker xxmaj statement , shows he 's yet another uncritical acolyte of xxmaj chomsky 's . xxmaj other than that , one of the xxunk signs that this is not an objective documentary , but mere agitprop , and a vanity piece of agitprop , at that , is that not a single time is xxmaj chomsky shown struggling with an answer . xxmaj he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds . \n"," \n","  xxmaj given that much of this dreck was filmed during xxmaj chomsky 's lectures at mcmaster xxmaj university , in xxmaj ontario , xxmaj canada , prior to the xxmaj american invasion of xxmaj iraq in 2003 , much of what xxmaj chomsky says seems as remote as things from the xxmaj vietnam xxmaj war era . xxmaj yes , he makes some good points , here and there , on xxmaj american media complicity before the war , but he follows them up with sheer lunacy , for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc , and not fully plotted out xxunk . xxmaj as example , he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace , but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled . xxmaj similarly , he claims xxmaj xxunk run the world and that people 's fear of crime is yet another cabal 's result . xxmaj of course , that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers , and all that wasted time and money district attorneys ' offices consume . xxmaj he also makes the absurd claim that xxmaj cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades , when xxmaj castro and company were great sponsors of it , in xxmaj latin xxmaj america , xxmaj asia , and xxmaj africa , until the xxmaj soviet xxmaj union fell . i can only guess that the xxup ufo xxunk are just waiting for xxmaj chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species - mixing impregnation centers up in xxmaj idaho . \n"," \n","  xxmaj in his simpleminded world without grays , xxmaj chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of xxmaj xxunk , whom he reviles , are ; even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals . xxmaj in short , xxmaj chomsky is a man living in the past , in over his head on most issues , and out of his depth intellectually . xxmaj near this film 's end he warns , ' xxmaj be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice , ' yet one can only laugh , as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he did n't like , no matter how barbarous their crimes , and anti - intellectual their posit . xxmaj please , pause before you waste your time and money on this silly , and already irrelevant , xxup dvd .,xxbos xxup warning ! xxmaj this review will reveal the ending of the movie , \" xxmaj scoop . \" xxmaj if you do n't want to know how the movie ends , do n't read this review ! \n"," \n","  \" xxmaj scoop \" is so bad you 'll think \" xxmaj annie xxmaj hall \" was a fluke . \n"," \n","  xxmaj it gets one star because you get to see xxmaj hugh xxmaj jackman 's naked chest . xxmaj that 's the only thing \" xxmaj scoop \" has going for it . \n"," \n","  xxmaj woody xxmaj allen 's misogyny , and his fixation on women young enough , at this point , to be his granddaughter , has crippled any ability to make movies he may have had at any point . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the plot seems promising : a ghost , xxmaj ian mcshane , directs a fluffy headed student , xxmaj scarlett xxmaj johansson , to investigate whether or not an xxmaj english xxmaj lord , xxmaj hugh xxmaj jackman , is the notorious xxmaj tarot xxmaj card xxmaj killer of prostitutes . a magician , xxmaj woody xxmaj allen , helps the girl . \n"," \n","  xxmaj promising plot notwithstanding , the movie completely lacks charm , or humor , or atmosphere . xxmaj it 's an amazingly leaden , amateurish effort for someone who has made even one previous film , never mind dozens . xxmaj perhaps xxmaj allen has had a stroke that has gone unreported in the press . \n"," \n","  xxmaj much is made of the fact that unlike in his previous films , xxmaj woody xxmaj allen , now a xxunk , has xxup finally allowed a younger male lead to get the girl . \n"," \n","  xxmaj not so . xxmaj in fact , the plot is constructed in such a way so that the girl gets no one . \n"," \n","  xxmaj there is an early scene where xxmaj johansson , for no reason central to the movie , allows herself to be gotten drunk , and seduced , by a powerful , older director . \" xxmaj seduced \" is a euphemism for what happens . xxmaj it 's a \" slam , bam , i 've got ta go \" kind of moment . xxmaj it bears no relation to the plot whatsoever , and it cheapens xxmaj johansson in the viewer 's eye . xxmaj why did xxmaj allen add that unnecessary scene to the movie ? xxmaj because it shows a powerful director -

minutes of actual film ) . xxmaj but what it can not explain is its lack of humor that the previous film possessed . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the gags are quick and sometimes not even funny . xxmaj the only true funny parts are the quick spoofs on the xxmaj nike basketball spots , xxmaj james xxmaj woods ' portrayal of xxmaj max xxmaj van xxmaj sydow 's character in the xxmaj exorcist , and bits and pieces scattered throughout the film . xxmaj very unfunny was the take off of xxmaj charlie 's xxmaj angels , which like the first xxmaj scary xxmaj movie and the xxmaj matrix spin off scene , basically recreated the scene without much humor injected into it . \n"," \n","  xxmaj today 's youth might not be able to relate to the spoof gags of the classic supernatural horror films of the 70 's such as the xxmaj exorcist and maybe of the 80s ' xxmaj poltergeist , et . al . \n"," \n","  xxmaj hopefully xxmaj scary xxmaj movie 3 will take some time to put together , making the spoofs more enjoyable . \n"," \n","  xxmaj one thing though , the film features more than the last one of promising young actress xxmaj anna xxmaj faris ( whom i will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel ) . xxmaj just for her casting and acting ability , i give this movie a \" 3 \" out of \" 10 \" .,xxbos this is the first time i 'm writing a comment on a movie on imdb . but i had to write it for this one . its 3 hrs of unadulterated torture . from the starting u get the idea that the movie is gon na be bad . the acting is pathetic . i 'm a big fan of xxmaj ajay devgan ( loved him in bhagat singh ) but he is at his worst in this movie . amitabh seems to have worked hard for this one , but somehow the fear is missing . prashant raj is a non actor . and the most irritating part of the movie is nisha kothari . i have no clue why the director took her in this movie . the background score is repetitive . somehow i felt that ramu tried to repeat a sarkar , the color theme , the background score , the camera angles , but it did n't work . xxup please xxmaj do n't xxup watch xxup it,xxbos xxmaj despite having known people who are either great fans of xxmaj noam xxmaj chomsky , or think he 's a tired relic from the 1960s , i really had no opinion of the man , save that i knew he gained fame as a linguist , although i could not elucidate any of his theories , and that he was a liberal socialist with xxmaj marxist leanings . xxmaj so , stumbling across the xxup dvd of the 2003 documentary xxmaj noam xxmaj chomsky : xxmaj rebel xxmaj without a xxmaj pause , in a used video store , a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 9 - 11 , i decided to get it , just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person , pro or con , spoke of him . xxmaj while glad i got the film , my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was , so what 's all the fuss about ? \n"," \n","  xxmaj for a man with so many degrees , lauded as ' the most important intellectual alive ' , by the xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj times , according to the xxup dvd 's case , there sure was not a lot there , intellectually speaking . i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate , and i would n't even want to watch what a xxmaj william xxup f. xxmaj buckley could do to him . xxmaj granted , the whole film was seemingly about xxmaj chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere , and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he 'd say , rather than being on linguistics , so maybe that 's the reason he came off so badly . xxmaj but , again , if he is a linguist , and tops in his field , why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise ? \n"," . xxmaj even worse are his acolytes , who seem to further xxunk the man from reality , by fostering delusions that xxmaj chomsky is a target for xxmaj zionist assassins . xxmaj what little i knew of xxmaj chomsky before watching this film , this much i knew : he was generally considered a has been , and pretty much irrelevant intellectually , since the fall of the xxmaj soviet xxmaj empire . xxmaj the film is so poorly structured , and without a narrative thread , that it 's difficult to separate all of the jumble . xxmaj his wife , xxmaj carol , as example , apparently gave one interview , which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film . xxmaj she seems a nice enough woman , but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life . xxmaj the lone interesting thing she says is that 9 / 11 was a great thing for the xxmaj xxunk , for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then . \n"," \n","  xxmaj not surprisingly , this sort of film gives almost no biographical background . xxmaj it 's assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this ' great man ' bears . xxmaj chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one . xxmaj stylistically , there are no camera movements , no interesting edits , nor any signature touches , and most of the film is xxunk rambles by xxmaj chomsky , videotaped xxunk of xxmaj chomsky declaiming on this or that , and slack - jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial , that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him . xxmaj this is really poor film - making by director and editor xxmaj will xxmaj pascoe , who in the xxup dvd 's xxmaj filmmaker xxmaj statement , shows he 's yet another uncritical acolyte of xxmaj chomsky 's . xxmaj other than that , one of the xxunk signs that this is not an objective documentary , but mere agitprop , and a vanity piece of agitprop , at that , is that not a single time is xxmaj chomsky shown struggling with an answer . xxmaj he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds . \n"," \n","  xxmaj given that much of this dreck was filmed during xxmaj chomsky 's lectures at mcmaster xxmaj university , in xxmaj ontario , xxmaj canada , prior to the xxmaj american invasion of xxmaj iraq in 2003 , much of what xxmaj chomsky says seems as remote as things from the xxmaj vietnam xxmaj war era . xxmaj yes , he makes some good points , here and there , on xxmaj american media complicity before the war , but he follows them up with sheer lunacy , for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc , and not fully plotted out xxunk . xxmaj as example , he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace , but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled . xxmaj similarly , he claims xxmaj xxunk run the world and that people 's fear of crime is yet another cabal 's result . xxmaj of course , that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers , and all that wasted time and money district attorneys ' offices consume . xxmaj he also makes the absurd claim that xxmaj cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades , when xxmaj castro and company were great sponsors of it , in xxmaj latin xxmaj america , xxmaj asia , and xxmaj africa , until the xxmaj soviet xxmaj union fell . i can only guess that the xxup ufo xxunk are just waiting for xxmaj chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species - mixing impregnation centers up in xxmaj idaho . \n"," \n","  xxmaj in his simpleminded world without grays , xxmaj chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of xxmaj xxunk , whom he reviles , are ; even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals . xxmaj in short , xxmaj chomsky is a man living in the past , in over his head on most issues , and out of his depth intellectually . xxmaj near this film 's end he warns , ' xxmaj be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice , ' yet one can only laugh , as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he did n't like , no matter how barbarous their crimes , and anti - intellectual their posit . xxmaj please , pause before you waste your time and money on this silly , and already irrelevant , xxup dvd .,xxbos xxup warning ! xxmaj this review will reveal the ending of the movie , \" xxmaj scoop . \" xxmaj if you do n't want to know how the movie ends , do n't read this review ! \n"," \n","  \" xxmaj scoop \" is so bad you 'll think \" xxmaj annie xxmaj hall \" was a fluke . \n"," \n","  xxmaj it gets one star because you get to see xxmaj hugh xxmaj jackman 's naked chest . xxmaj that 's the only thing \" xxmaj scoop \" has going for it . \n"," \n","  xxmaj woody xxmaj allen 's misogyny , and his fixation on women young enough , at this point , to be his granddaughter , has crippled any ability to make movies he may have had at any point . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the plot seems promising : a ghost , xxmaj ian mcshane , directs a fluffy headed student , xxmaj scarlett xxmaj johansson , to investigate whether or not an xxmaj english xxmaj lord , xxmaj hugh xxmaj jackman , is the notorious xxmaj tarot xxmaj card xxmaj killer of prostitutes . a magician , xxmaj woody xxmaj allen , helps the girl . \n"," \n","  xxmaj promising plot notwithstanding , the movie completely lacks charm , or humor , or atmosphere . xxmaj it 's an amazingly leaden , amateurish effort for someone who has made even one previous film , never mind dozens . xxmaj perhaps xxmaj allen has had a stroke that has gone unreported in the press . \n"," \n","  xxmaj much is made of the fact that unlike in his previous films , xxmaj woody xxmaj allen , now a xxunk , has xxup finally allowed a younger male lead to get the girl . \n"," \n","  xxmaj not so . xxmaj in fact , the plot is constructed in such a way so that the girl gets no one . \n"," \n","  xxmaj there is an early scene where xxmaj johansson , for no reason central to the movie , allows herself to be gotten drunk , and seduced , by a powerful , older director . \" xxmaj seduced \" is a euphemism for what happens . xxmaj it 's a \" slam , bam , i 've got ta go \" kind of moment . xxmaj it bears no relation to the plot whatsoever , and it cheapens xxmaj johansson in the viewer 's eye . xxmaj why did xxmaj allen add that unnecessary scene to the movie ? xxmaj because it shows a powerful director - like xxmaj allen - having sex with the female lead . xxmaj allen gets to have his cake and eat it , too . \n"," \n","  xxmaj johansson is not yet an actress . xxmaj she does n't know how to command the screen except by wearing a tight , low cut top . xxmaj she imitates xxmaj allen in a couple of scenes , and that just looks weird and sad . \n"," \n","  xxmaj it does n't help that her character is scripted as a doll who ca n't function without a ghost , or an elderly and less than awe - inspiring magician , telling her what to do at every turn . \n"," \n","  xxmaj she is approximately half xxmaj jackman 's age , and she comes across as a very vapid screen presence in their scenes together . \n"," \n","  xxmaj audience members not obsessed with breasts deserve better in their heroines , and xxmaj jackman deserves better , too -- a script that gives the heroine some intelligence and agency , and an actress who can convey those qualities . \n"," \n","  xxmaj hugh xxmaj jackman is similarly cheated by the script . xxmaj allen apparently ca n't stand it that xxmaj jackman is so stunningly good looking and young , and so he gives xxmaj jackman nothing to say or do . xxmaj like xxmaj johansson , he is used merely for his good looks . xxmaj this is a shame , because , as xxmaj jackman has shown in any number of productions , from \" xxmaj oklahoma \" to \" x xxmaj men , \" he xxup can act . \n"," \n","  xxmaj here 's the big plot twist -- xxmaj jackman , suave , charming xxmaj english xxmaj lord , really is a killer . xxmaj so , though the movie says it is all about letting someone else , other than xxmaj allen , get the girl , she does n't get anyone . xxmaj jackman , the man she 's been making love to , is a man who murdered a prostitute . xxmaj nice , xxmaj woody . xxmaj nice way to punish your heroine for being beyond your grasp . \n"," \n","  xxmaj in a passive aggressive touch , xxmaj allen deprives his heroine of his own presence , as well , killing off his character , the magician , leaving xxmaj scarlett xxmaj johansson all alone at the end of the film . \n"," \n","  a final note : at my screening , not a single audience member laughed at any point during the film . xxmaj always a bad sign when a film is advertised as a comedy .,xxbos xxmaj who ? xxmaj what ? xxmaj where ? xxmaj when ? xxmaj why ? xxmaj the acting was terrible . xxmaj very robotic , rehearsed . i have seen all of the actors in this film in better roles . xxmaj the screenplay was very elementary . xxmaj by the end of this film , the story line was tied up . xxmaj and xxmaj jeane xxmaj claude xxunk should be tied up , too . xxmaj so that he never attempts to write / direct another film .\n","y: CategoryList\n","neg,neg,neg,neg,neg\n","Path: /root/.fastai/data/imdb;\n","\n","Valid: LabelList

featuring a nice montage of the \" xxmaj alice in xxmaj wonderland \" sculpture . xxmaj the symbolism incorporated into these elements supports the possibility that xxmaj waye ( despite the absence of a linear logic or unity of tone ) actually has some visionary talent and aspirations for making a quality film . \n"," \n","  xxmaj it is even possible that xxmaj waye was trying for a fusion of the somewhat expressionistic \" xxmaj metropolitan \" and the camp classic \" xxmaj cruel xxmaj intentions \" which also deal with the xxmaj manhattan upper class . xxmaj there are many camera shots framed by windows and doors yet few tight shots of faces and eyes . xxmaj the former technique hinting at symbolism and the latter at intentional distancing from the characters and their motivations . \" xxmaj tart \" seemed on the verge of veering into camp territory at least twice and would have been well advised to keep going in that direction . xxmaj first there was the scene where they try to dump the seemingly deceased xxmaj swain into the garbage chute . xxmaj then there is the whole bit about her father being xxmaj jewish ( played to the same extreme as xxmaj joel xxmaj grey dancing with the xxmaj jewish guerrilla in \" xxmaj cabaret \" ) . \n"," \n","  xxmaj in her other films xxmaj swain 's acting technique is to overwhelm each scene in which she appears ( insert scenery chewing here ) but in \" xxmaj tart \" she actually shows an ability to restrain herself . xxmaj this is the best performance of her career . xxmaj it also provides some clues about her physical deterioration from willowy super cute in \" xxmaj girl \" to hulking lumpy - faced in \" xxmaj pumpkin \" . xxmaj this transformation was about half - complete by the time she made \" xxmaj tart \" ; so go the ravages of time . \n"," \n","  xxmaj mischa xxmaj barton ( \" xxmaj sixth xxmaj sense 's \" i feel better girl ) and xxmaj lacey xxmaj xxunk are excellent in supporting roles . xxmaj the rest of the cast is simply horrible , although some of the blame for this should go to xxmaj waye 's script and direction .,xxbos another eli roth in the making . self promoting , bad script writing excuse for a horror director . victor is as far from the new horror icon as mary poppins ( reference to the xxmaj disney score ) . what is going on here ? you have marilyn manson opening and closing this piece of crap and chitty chitty bang bang all through it . can this even be called horror ? horrible , yes , but horror is a stretch . xxmaj david lynch should sue them for stealing the elephant man prosthetics . please stop these fan boy want to be directors now . the video directors already have enough competition breaking into the film industry . getting online and talking about how great your movie is does not make it true . stop the insanity . i work in the industry and yes these films are fun to work on , but rarely ever entertaining to actually watch .,xxbos xxmaj wow , what exciting visual effects . i also loved the costumes and artwork , the circus and ethereal feel to the film was sublime . xxmaj it just required the need for the viewer to worry about the fate of our protagonist . xxmaj as she is trapped in her imagination , there is never a sense of peril unlike , say , xxmaj david xxmaj lynch 's films which haunt every time . xxmaj this also draws attention to which age group this film is aimed at . xxmaj who would this engage ? \n"," \n","  xxmaj mirrormask is obviously going to draw comparisons with xxmaj labyrinth with the xxunk angst / fantasy theme , but unfortunately it does n't really come close to delivering the same xxmaj henson essence . xxmaj the ill mother theme is never fully explained and certainly not something that you care about while lapping up the eye candy . \n"," \n","  xxmaj not agonisingly awful a la xxmaj the xxmaj cell , nor as engagingly dreamlike as xxmaj labyrinth -

11 , i decided to get it , just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person , pro or con , spoke of him . xxmaj while glad i got the film , my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was , so what 's all the fuss about ? \n"," \n","  xxmaj for a man with so many degrees , lauded as ' the most important intellectual alive ' , by the xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj times , according to the xxup dvd 's case , there sure was not a lot there , intellectually speaking . i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate , and i would n't even want to watch what a xxmaj william xxup f. xxmaj buckley could do to him . xxmaj granted , the whole film was seemingly about xxmaj chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere , and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he 'd say , rather than being on linguistics , so maybe that 's the reason he came off so badly . xxmaj but , again , if he is a linguist , and tops in his field , why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise ? \n"," . xxmaj even worse are his acolytes , who seem to further xxunk the man from reality , by fostering delusions that xxmaj chomsky is a target for xxmaj zionist assassins . xxmaj what little i knew of xxmaj chomsky before watching this film , this much i knew : he was generally considered a has been , and pretty much irrelevant intellectually , since the fall of the xxmaj soviet xxmaj empire . xxmaj the film is so poorly structured , and without a narrative thread , that it 's difficult to separate all of the jumble . xxmaj his wife , xxmaj carol , as example , apparently gave one interview , which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film . xxmaj she seems a nice enough woman , but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life . xxmaj the lone interesting thing she says is that 9 / 11 was a great thing for the xxmaj xxunk , for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then . \n"," \n","  xxmaj not surprisingly , this sort of film gives almost no biographical background . xxmaj it 's assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this ' great man ' bears . xxmaj chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one . xxmaj stylistically , there are no camera movements , no interesting edits , nor any signature touches , and most of the film is xxunk rambles by xxmaj chomsky , videotaped xxunk of xxmaj chomsky declaiming on this or that , and slack - jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial , that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him . xxmaj this is really poor film - making by director and editor xxmaj will xxmaj pascoe , who in the xxup dvd 's xxmaj filmmaker xxmaj statement , shows he 's yet another uncritical acolyte of xxmaj chomsky 's . xxmaj other than that , one of the xxunk signs that this is not an objective documentary , but mere agitprop , and a vanity piece of agitprop , at that , is that not a single time is xxmaj chomsky shown struggling with an answer . xxmaj he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds . \n"," \n","  xxmaj given that much of this dreck was filmed during xxmaj chomsky 's lectures at mcmaster xxmaj university , in xxmaj ontario , xxmaj canada , prior to the xxmaj american invasion of xxmaj iraq in 2003 , much of what xxmaj chomsky says seems as remote as things from the xxmaj vietnam xxmaj war era . xxmaj yes , he makes some good points , here and there , on xxmaj american media complicity before the war , but he follows them up with sheer lunacy , for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc , and not fully plotted out xxunk . xxmaj as example , he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace , but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled . xxmaj similarly , he claims xxmaj xxunk run the world and that people 's fear of crime is yet another cabal 's result . xxmaj of course , that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers , and all that wasted time and money district attorneys ' offices consume . xxmaj he also makes the absurd claim that xxmaj cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades , when xxmaj castro and company were great sponsors of it , in xxmaj latin xxmaj america , xxmaj asia , and xxmaj africa , until the xxmaj soviet xxmaj union fell . i can only guess that the xxup ufo xxunk are just waiting for xxmaj chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species - mixing impregnation centers up in xxmaj idaho . \n"," \n","  xxmaj in his simpleminded world without grays , xxmaj chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of xxmaj xxunk , whom he reviles , are ; even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals . xxmaj in short , xxmaj chomsky is a man living in the past , in over his head on most issues , and out of his depth intellectually . xxmaj near this film 's end he warns , ' xxmaj be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice , ' yet one can only laugh , as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he did n't like , no matter how barbarous their crimes , and anti -

11 , i decided to get it , just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person , pro or con , spoke of him . xxmaj while glad i got the film , my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was , so what 's all the fuss about ? \n"," \n","  xxmaj for a man with so many degrees , lauded as ' the most important intellectual alive ' , by the xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj times , according to the xxup dvd 's case , there sure was not a lot there , intellectually speaking . i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate , and i would n't even want to watch what a xxmaj william xxup f. xxmaj buckley could do to him . xxmaj granted , the whole film was seemingly about xxmaj chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere , and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he 'd say , rather than being on linguistics , so maybe that 's the reason he came off so badly . xxmaj but , again , if he is a linguist , and tops in his field , why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise ? \n"," . xxmaj even worse are his acolytes , who seem to further xxunk the man from reality , by fostering delusions that xxmaj chomsky is a target for xxmaj zionist assassins . xxmaj what little i knew of xxmaj chomsky before watching this film , this much i knew : he was generally considered a has been , and pretty much irrelevant intellectually , since the fall of the xxmaj soviet xxmaj empire . xxmaj the film is so poorly structured , and without a narrative thread , that it 's difficult to separate all of the jumble . xxmaj his wife , xxmaj carol , as example , apparently gave one interview , which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film . xxmaj she seems a nice enough woman , but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life . xxmaj the lone interesting thing she says is that 9 / 11 was a great thing for the xxmaj xxunk , for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then . \n"," \n","  xxmaj not surprisingly , this sort of film gives almost no biographical background . xxmaj it 's assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this ' great man ' bears . xxmaj chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one . xxmaj stylistically , there are no camera movements , no interesting edits , nor any signature touches , and most of the film is xxunk rambles by xxmaj chomsky , videotaped xxunk of xxmaj chomsky declaiming on this or that , and slack - jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial , that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him . xxmaj this is really poor film - making by director and editor xxmaj will xxmaj pascoe , who in the xxup dvd 's xxmaj filmmaker xxmaj statement , shows he 's yet another uncritical acolyte of xxmaj chomsky 's . xxmaj other than that , one of the xxunk signs that this is not an objective documentary , but mere agitprop , and a vanity piece of agitprop , at that , is that not a single time is xxmaj chomsky shown struggling with an answer . xxmaj he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds . \n"," \n","  xxmaj given that much of this dreck was filmed during xxmaj chomsky 's lectures at mcmaster xxmaj university , in xxmaj ontario , xxmaj canada , prior to the xxmaj american invasion of xxmaj iraq in 2003 , much of what xxmaj chomsky says seems as remote as things from the xxmaj vietnam xxmaj war era . xxmaj yes , he makes some good points , here and there , on xxmaj american media complicity before the war , but he follows them up with sheer lunacy , for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc , and not fully plotted out xxunk . xxmaj as example , he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace , but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled . xxmaj similarly , he claims xxmaj xxunk run the world and that people 's fear of crime is yet another cabal 's result . xxmaj of course , that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers , and all that wasted time and money district attorneys ' offices consume . xxmaj he also makes the absurd claim that xxmaj cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades , when xxmaj castro and company were great sponsors of it , in xxmaj latin xxmaj america , xxmaj asia , and xxmaj africa , until the xxmaj soviet xxmaj union fell . i can only guess that the xxup ufo xxunk are just waiting for xxmaj chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species - mixing impregnation centers up in xxmaj idaho . \n"," \n","  xxmaj in his simpleminded world without grays , xxmaj chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of xxmaj xxunk , whom he reviles , are ; even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals . xxmaj in short , xxmaj chomsky is a man living in the past , in over his head on most issues , and out of his depth intellectually . xxmaj near this film 's end he warns , ' xxmaj be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice , ' yet one can only laugh , as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he did n't like , no matter how barbarous their crimes , and anti - intellectual their posit . xxmaj please , pause before you waste your time and money on this silly , and already irrelevant , xxup dvd .,xxbos xxup warning ! xxmaj this review will reveal the ending of the movie , \" xxmaj scoop . \" xxmaj if you do n't want to know how the movie ends , do n't read this review ! \n"," \n","  \" xxmaj scoop \" is so bad you 'll think \" xxmaj annie xxmaj hall \" was a fluke . \n"," \n","  xxmaj it gets one star because you get to see xxmaj hugh xxmaj jackman 's naked chest . xxmaj that 's the only thing \" xxmaj scoop \" has going for it . \n"," \n","  xxmaj woody xxmaj allen 's misogyny , and his fixation on women young enough , at this point , to be his granddaughter , has crippled any ability to make movies he may have had at any point . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the plot seems promising : a ghost , xxmaj ian mcshane , directs a fluffy headed student , xxmaj scarlett xxmaj johansson , to investigate whether or not an xxmaj english xxmaj lord , xxmaj hugh xxmaj jackman , is the notorious xxmaj tarot xxmaj card xxmaj killer of prostitutes . a magician , xxmaj woody xxmaj allen , helps the girl . \n"," \n","  xxmaj promising plot notwithstanding , the movie completely lacks charm , or humor , or atmosphere . xxmaj it 's an amazingly leaden , amateurish effort for someone who has made even one previous film , never mind dozens . xxmaj perhaps xxmaj allen has had a stroke that has gone unreported in the press . \n"," \n","  xxmaj much is made of the fact that unlike in his previous films , xxmaj woody xxmaj allen , now a xxunk , has xxup finally allowed a younger male lead to get the girl . \n"," \n","  xxmaj not so . xxmaj in fact , the plot is constructed in such a way so that the girl gets no one . \n"," \n","  xxmaj there is an early scene where xxmaj johansson , for no reason central to the movie , allows herself to be gotten drunk , and seduced , by a powerful , older director . \" xxmaj seduced \" is a euphemism for what happens . xxmaj it 's a \" slam , bam , i 've got ta go \" kind of moment . xxmaj it bears no relation to the plot whatsoever , and it cheapens xxmaj johansson in the viewer 's eye . xxmaj why did xxmaj allen add that unnecessary scene to the movie ? xxmaj because it shows a powerful director - like xxmaj allen - having sex with the female lead . xxmaj allen gets to have his cake and eat it , too . \n"," \n","  xxmaj johansson is not yet an actress . xxmaj she does n't know how to command the screen except by wearing a tight , low cut top . xxmaj she imitates xxmaj allen in a couple of scenes , and that just looks weird and sad . \n"," \n","  xxmaj it does n't help that her character is scripted as a doll who ca n't function without a ghost , or an elderly and less than awe - inspiring magician , telling her what to do at every turn . \n"," \n","  xxmaj she is approximately half xxmaj jackman 's age , and she comes across as a very vapid screen presence in their scenes together . \n"," \n","  xxmaj audience members not obsessed with breasts deserve better in their heroines , and xxmaj jackman deserves better , too -- a script that gives the heroine some intelligence and agency , and an actress who can convey those qualities . \n"," \n","  xxmaj hugh xxmaj jackman is similarly cheated by the script . xxmaj allen apparently ca n't stand it that xxmaj jackman is so stunningly good looking and young , and so he gives xxmaj jackman nothing to say or do . xxmaj like xxmaj johansson , he is used merely for his good looks . xxmaj this is a shame , because , as xxmaj jackman has shown in any number of productions , from \" xxmaj oklahoma \" to \" x xxmaj men , \" he xxup can act . \n"," \n","  xxmaj here 's the big plot twist -- xxmaj jackman , suave , charming xxmaj english xxmaj lord , really is a killer . xxmaj so , though the movie says it is all about letting someone else , other than xxmaj allen , get the girl , she does n't get anyone . xxmaj jackman , the man she 's been making love to , is a man who murdered a prostitute . xxmaj nice , xxmaj woody . xxmaj nice way to punish your heroine for being beyond your grasp . \n"," \n","  xxmaj in a passive aggressive touch , xxmaj allen deprives his heroine of his own presence , as well , killing off his character , the magician , leaving xxmaj scarlett xxmaj johansson all alone at the end of the film . \n"," \n","  a final note : at my screening , not a single audience member laughed at any point during the film . xxmaj always a bad sign when a film is advertised as a comedy .,xxbos xxmaj who ? xxmaj what ? xxmaj where ? xxmaj when ? xxmaj why ? xxmaj the acting was terrible . xxmaj very robotic , rehearsed . i have seen all of the actors in this film in better roles . xxmaj the screenplay was very elementary . xxmaj by the end of this film , the story line was tied up . xxmaj and xxmaj jeane xxmaj claude xxunk should be tied up , too . xxmaj so that he never attempts to write / direct another film .\n","y: CategoryList\n","neg,neg,neg,neg,neg\n","Path: /root/.fastai/data/imdb;\n","\n","Valid: LabelList (25000 items)\n","x: TextList\n","xxbos xxmaj this is what they came up with for prop comedian xxmaj carrot xxmaj top 's first feature film . \n"," \n","  a stupid surfer ( carrot dude ) inherits an xxup xxunk enterprise from an old kahuna ( xxmaj jack xxmaj warden ) . xxmaj things go less than swimmingly , but get much worse when the company is threatened with a hostile takeover attempt by corrupt corporate raiders . xxmaj the most implausible thing about this movie is that smart -

. \n"," \n","  xxmaj unlike the standard xxmaj swain film , \" xxmaj tart \" actually employed a competent and experienced production designer . xxmaj good enough to provide two extremely nice shots : the scene of xxmaj swain and xxmaj barton taking a bubble bath together and the scene of xxmaj swain in the park - featuring a nice montage of the \" xxmaj alice in xxmaj wonderland \" sculpture .

former technique hinting at symbolism and the latter at intentional distancing from the characters and their motivations . \" xxmaj tart \" seemed on the verge of veering into camp territory at least twice and would have been well advised to keep going in that direction . xxmaj first there was the scene where they try to dump the seemingly deceased xxmaj swain into the garbage chute . xxmaj then

LabelList (25000 items)\n","x: TextList\n","xxbos xxmaj given that this movie was put together in less than a year might explain its shortness ( 81 minutes - including end credits , so roughly 76 minutes of actual film ) . xxmaj but what it can not explain is its lack of humor that the previous film possessed . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the gags are quick and sometimes not even funny . xxmaj the only true funny parts are the quick spoofs on the xxmaj nike basketball spots , xxmaj james xxmaj woods ' portrayal of xxmaj max xxmaj van xxmaj sydow 's character in the xxmaj exorcist , and bits and pieces scattered throughout the film . xxmaj very unfunny was the take off of xxmaj charlie 's xxmaj angels , which like the first xxmaj scary xxmaj movie and the xxmaj matrix spin off scene , basically recreated the scene without much humor injected into it . \n"," \n","  xxmaj today 's youth might not be able to relate to the spoof gags of the classic supernatural horror films of the 70 's such as the xxmaj exorcist and maybe of the 80s ' xxmaj poltergeist , et . al . \n"," \n","  xxmaj hopefully xxmaj scary xxmaj movie 3 will take some time to put together , making the spoofs more enjoyable . \n"," \n","  xxmaj one thing though , the film features more than the last one of promising young actress xxmaj anna xxmaj faris ( whom i will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel ) . xxmaj just for her casting and acting ability , i give this movie a \" 3 \" out of \" 10 \" .,xxbos this is the first time i 'm writing a comment on a movie on imdb . but i had to write it for this one . its 3 hrs of unadulterated torture . from the starting u get the idea that the movie is gon na be bad . the acting is pathetic . i 'm a big fan of xxmaj ajay devgan ( loved him in bhagat singh ) but he is at his worst in this movie . amitabh seems to have worked hard for this one , but somehow the fear is missing . prashant raj is a non actor . and the most irritating part of the movie is nisha kothari . i have no clue why the director took her in this movie . the background score is repetitive . somehow i felt that ramu tried to repeat a sarkar , the color theme , the background score , the camera angles , but it did n't work . xxup please xxmaj do n't xxup watch xxup it,xxbos xxmaj despite having known people who are either great fans of xxmaj noam xxmaj chomsky , or think he 's a tired relic from the 1960s , i really had no opinion of the man , save that i knew he gained fame as a linguist , although i could not elucidate any of his theories , and that he was a liberal socialist with xxmaj marxist leanings . xxmaj so , stumbling across the xxup dvd of the 2003 documentary xxmaj noam xxmaj chomsky : xxmaj rebel xxmaj without a xxmaj pause , in a used video store , a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 9 - 11 , i decided to get it , just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person , pro or con , spoke of him . xxmaj while glad i got the film , my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was , so what 's all the fuss about ? \n"," \n","  xxmaj for a man with so many degrees , lauded as ' the most important intellectual alive ' , by the xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj times , according to the xxup dvd 's case , there sure was not a lot there , intellectually speaking . i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate , and i would n't even want to watch what a xxmaj william xxup f. xxmaj buckley could do to him . xxmaj granted , the whole film was seemingly about xxmaj chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere , and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he 'd say , rather than being on linguistics , so maybe that 's the reason he came off so badly . xxmaj but , again , if he is a linguist , and tops in his field , why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise ? \n"," . xxmaj even worse are his acolytes , who seem to further xxunk the man from reality , by fostering delusions that xxmaj chomsky is a target for xxmaj zionist assassins . xxmaj what little i knew of xxmaj chomsky before watching this film , this much i knew : he was generally considered a has been , and pretty much irrelevant intellectually , since the fall of the xxmaj soviet xxmaj empire . xxmaj the film is so poorly structured , and without a narrative thread , that it 's difficult to separate all of the jumble . xxmaj his wife , xxmaj carol , as example , apparently gave one interview , which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film . xxmaj she seems a nice enough woman , but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life . xxmaj the lone interesting thing she says is that 9 / 11 was a great thing for the xxmaj xxunk , for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then . \n"," \n","  xxmaj not surprisingly , this sort of film gives almost no biographical background . xxmaj it 's assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this ' great man ' bears . xxmaj chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one . xxmaj stylistically , there are no camera movements , no interesting edits , nor any signature touches , and most of the film is xxunk rambles by xxmaj chomsky , videotaped xxunk of xxmaj chomsky declaiming on this or that , and slack - jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial , that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him . xxmaj this is really poor film - making by director and editor xxmaj will xxmaj pascoe , who in the xxup dvd 's xxmaj filmmaker xxmaj statement , shows he 's yet another uncritical acolyte of xxmaj chomsky 's . xxmaj other than that , one of the xxunk signs that this is not an objective documentary , but mere agitprop , and a vanity piece of agitprop , at that , is that not a single time is xxmaj chomsky shown struggling with an answer . xxmaj he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds . \n"," \n","  xxmaj given that much of this dreck was filmed during xxmaj chomsky 's lectures at mcmaster xxmaj university , in xxmaj ontario , xxmaj canada , prior to the xxmaj american invasion of xxmaj iraq in 2003 , much of what xxmaj chomsky says seems as remote as things from the xxmaj vietnam xxmaj war era . xxmaj yes , he makes some good points , here and there , on xxmaj american media complicity before the war , but he follows them up with sheer lunacy , for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc , and not fully plotted out xxunk . xxmaj as example , he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace , but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled . xxmaj similarly , he claims xxmaj xxunk run the world and that people 's fear of crime is yet another cabal 's result . xxmaj of course , that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers , and all that wasted time and money district attorneys ' offices consume . xxmaj he also makes the absurd claim that xxmaj cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades , when xxmaj castro and company were great sponsors of it , in xxmaj latin xxmaj america , xxmaj asia , and xxmaj africa , until the xxmaj soviet xxmaj union fell . i can only guess that the xxup ufo xxunk are just waiting for xxmaj chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species - mixing impregnation centers up in xxmaj idaho . \n"," \n","  xxmaj in his simpleminded world without grays , xxmaj chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of xxmaj xxunk , whom he reviles , are ; even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals . xxmaj in short , xxmaj chomsky is a man living in the past , in over his head on most issues , and out of his depth intellectually . xxmaj near this film 's end he warns , ' xxmaj be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice , ' yet one can only laugh , as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he did n't like , no matter how barbarous their crimes , and anti - intellectual their posit . xxmaj please , pause before you waste your time and money on this silly , and already irrelevant , xxup dvd .,xxbos xxup warning ! xxmaj this review will reveal the ending of the movie , \" xxmaj scoop . \" xxmaj if you do n't want to know how the movie ends , do n't read this review ! \n"," \n","  \" xxmaj scoop \" is so bad you 'll think \" xxmaj annie xxmaj hall \" was a fluke . \n"," \n","  xxmaj it gets one star because you get to see xxmaj hugh xxmaj jackman 's naked chest . xxmaj that 's the only thing \" xxmaj scoop \" has going for it . \n"," \n","  xxmaj woody xxmaj allen 's misogyny , and his fixation on women young enough , at this point , to be his granddaughter , has crippled any ability to make movies he may have had at any point . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the plot seems promising : a ghost , xxmaj ian mcshane , directs a fluffy headed student , xxmaj scarlett xxmaj johansson , to investigate whether or not an xxmaj english xxmaj lord , xxmaj hugh xxmaj jackman , is the notorious xxmaj tarot xxmaj card xxmaj killer of prostitutes . a magician , xxmaj woody xxmaj allen , helps the girl . \n"," \n","  xxmaj promising plot notwithstanding , the movie completely lacks charm , or humor , or atmosphere . xxmaj it 's an amazingly leaden , amateurish effort for someone who

11 , i decided to get it , just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person , pro or con , spoke of him . xxmaj while glad i got the film , my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was , so what 's all the fuss about ? \n"," \n","  xxmaj for a man with so many degrees , lauded as ' the most important intellectual alive ' , by the xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj times , according to the xxup dvd 's case , there sure was not a lot there , intellectually speaking . i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate , and i would n't even want to watch what a xxmaj william xxup f. xxmaj buckley could do to him . xxmaj granted , the whole film was seemingly about xxmaj chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere , and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he 'd say , rather than being on linguistics , so maybe that 's the reason he came off so badly . xxmaj but , again , if he is a linguist , and tops in his field , why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise ? \n"," . xxmaj even worse are his acolytes , who seem to further xxunk the man from reality , by fostering delusions that xxmaj chomsky is a target for xxmaj zionist assassins . xxmaj what little i knew of xxmaj chomsky before watching this film , this much i knew : he was generally considered a has been , and pretty much irrelevant intellectually , since the fall of the xxmaj soviet xxmaj empire . xxmaj the film is so poorly structured , and without a narrative thread , that it 's difficult to separate all of the jumble . xxmaj his wife , xxmaj carol , as example , apparently gave one interview , which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film . xxmaj she seems a nice enough woman , but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life . xxmaj the lone interesting thing she says is that 9 / 11 was a great thing for the xxmaj xxunk , for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then . \n"," \n","  xxmaj not surprisingly , this sort of film gives almost no biographical background . xxmaj it 's assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this ' great man ' bears . xxmaj chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one . xxmaj stylistically , there are no camera movements , no interesting edits , nor any signature touches , and most of the film is xxunk rambles by xxmaj chomsky , videotaped xxunk of xxmaj chomsky declaiming on this or that , and slack - jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial , that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him . xxmaj this is really poor film - making by director and editor xxmaj will xxmaj pascoe , who in the xxup dvd 's xxmaj filmmaker xxmaj statement , shows he 's yet another uncritical acolyte of xxmaj chomsky 's . xxmaj other than that , one of the xxunk signs that this is not an objective documentary , but mere agitprop , and a vanity piece of agitprop , at that , is that not a single time is xxmaj chomsky shown struggling with an answer . xxmaj he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds . \n"," \n","  xxmaj given that much of this dreck was filmed during xxmaj chomsky 's lectures at mcmaster xxmaj university , in xxmaj ontario , xxmaj canada , prior to the xxmaj american invasion of xxmaj iraq in 2003 , much of what xxmaj chomsky says seems as remote as things from the xxmaj vietnam xxmaj war era . xxmaj yes , he makes some good points , here and there , on xxmaj american media complicity before the war , but he follows them up with sheer lunacy , for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc , and not fully plotted out xxunk . xxmaj as example , he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace , but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled . xxmaj similarly , he claims xxmaj xxunk run the world and that people 's fear of crime is yet another cabal 's result . xxmaj of course , that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers , and all that wasted time and money district attorneys ' offices consume . xxmaj he also makes the absurd claim that xxmaj cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades , when xxmaj castro and company were great sponsors of it , in xxmaj latin xxmaj america , xxmaj asia , and xxmaj africa , until the xxmaj soviet xxmaj union fell . i can only guess that the xxup ufo xxunk are just waiting for xxmaj chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species -

11 , i decided to get it , just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person , pro or con , spoke of him . xxmaj while glad i got the film , my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was , so what 's all the fuss about ? \n"," \n","  xxmaj for a man with so many degrees , lauded as ' the most important intellectual alive ' , by the xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj times , according to the xxup dvd 's case , there sure was not a lot there , intellectually speaking . i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate , and i would n't even want to watch what a xxmaj william xxup f. xxmaj buckley could do to him . xxmaj granted , the whole film was seemingly about xxmaj chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere , and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he 'd say , rather than being on linguistics , so maybe that 's the reason he came off so badly . xxmaj but , again , if he is a linguist , and tops in his field , why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise ? \n"," . xxmaj even worse are his acolytes , who seem to further xxunk the man from reality , by fostering delusions that xxmaj chomsky is a target for xxmaj zionist assassins . xxmaj what little i knew of xxmaj chomsky before watching this film , this much i knew : he was generally considered a has been , and pretty much irrelevant intellectually , since the fall of the xxmaj soviet xxmaj empire . xxmaj the film is so poorly structured , and without a narrative thread , that it 's difficult to separate all of the jumble . xxmaj his wife , xxmaj carol , as example , apparently gave one interview , which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film . xxmaj she seems a nice enough woman , but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life . xxmaj the lone interesting thing she says is that 9 / 11 was a great thing for the xxmaj xxunk , for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then . \n"," \n","  xxmaj not surprisingly , this sort of film gives almost no biographical background . xxmaj it 's assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this ' great man ' bears . xxmaj chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one . xxmaj stylistically , there are no camera movements , no interesting edits , nor any signature touches , and most of the film is xxunk rambles by xxmaj chomsky , videotaped xxunk of xxmaj chomsky declaiming on this or that , and slack - jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial , that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him . xxmaj this is really poor film - making by director and editor xxmaj will xxmaj pascoe , who in the xxup dvd 's xxmaj filmmaker xxmaj statement , shows he 's yet another uncritical acolyte of xxmaj chomsky 's . xxmaj other than that , one of the xxunk signs that this is not an objective documentary , but mere agitprop , and a vanity piece of agitprop , at that , is that not a single time is xxmaj chomsky shown struggling with an answer . xxmaj he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds . \n"," \n","  xxmaj given that much of this dreck was filmed during xxmaj chomsky 's lectures at mcmaster xxmaj university , in xxmaj ontario , xxmaj canada , prior to the xxmaj american invasion of xxmaj iraq in 2003 , much of what xxmaj chomsky says seems as remote as things from the xxmaj vietnam xxmaj war era . xxmaj yes , he makes some good points , here and there , on xxmaj american media complicity before the war , but he follows them up with sheer lunacy , for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc , and not fully plotted out xxunk . xxmaj as example , he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace , but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled . xxmaj similarly , he claims xxmaj xxunk run the world and that people 's fear of crime is yet another cabal 's result . xxmaj of course , that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers , and all that wasted time and money district attorneys ' offices consume . xxmaj he also makes the absurd claim that xxmaj cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades , when xxmaj castro and company were great sponsors of it , in xxmaj latin xxmaj america , xxmaj asia , and xxmaj africa , until the xxmaj soviet xxmaj union fell . i can only guess that the xxup ufo xxunk are just waiting for xxmaj chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species - mixing impregnation centers up in xxmaj idaho . \n"," \n","  xxmaj in his simpleminded world without grays , xxmaj chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of xxmaj xxunk , whom he reviles , are ; even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals . xxmaj in short , xxmaj chomsky is a man living in the past , in over his head on most issues , and out of his depth intellectually . xxmaj near this film 's end he warns , ' xxmaj be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice , ' yet one can only laugh , as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he did n't like , no matter how barbarous their crimes , and anti - intellectual their posit . xxmaj please , pause before you waste your time and money on this silly , and already irrelevant , xxup dvd .,xxbos xxup warning ! xxmaj this review will reveal the ending of the movie , \" xxmaj scoop . \" xxmaj if you do n't want to know how the movie ends , do n't read this review ! \n"," \n","  \" xxmaj scoop \" is so bad you 'll think \" xxmaj annie xxmaj hall \" was a fluke . \n"," \n","  xxmaj it gets one star because you get to see xxmaj hugh xxmaj jackman 's naked chest . xxmaj that 's the only thing \" xxmaj scoop \" has going for it . \n"," \n","  xxmaj woody xxmaj allen 's misogyny , and his fixation on women young enough , at this point , to be his granddaughter , has crippled any ability to make movies he may have had at any point . \n"," \n","  xxmaj the plot seems promising : a ghost , xxmaj ian mcshane , directs a fluffy headed student , xxmaj scarlett xxmaj johansson , to investigate whether or not an xxmaj english xxmaj lord , xxmaj hugh xxmaj jackman , is the notorious xxmaj tarot xxmaj card xxmaj killer of prostitutes . a magician , xxmaj woody xxmaj allen , helps the girl . \n"," \n","  xxmaj promising plot notwithstanding , the movie completely lacks charm , or humor , or atmosphere . xxmaj it 's an amazingly leaden , amateurish effort for someone who has made even one previous film , never mind dozens . xxmaj perhaps xxmaj allen has had a stroke that has gone unreported in the press . \n"," \n","  xxmaj much is made of the fact that unlike in his previous films , xxmaj woody xxmaj allen , now a xxunk , has xxup finally allowed a younger male lead to get the girl . \n"," \n","  xxmaj not so . xxmaj in fact , the plot is constructed in such a way so that the girl gets no one . \n"," \n","  xxmaj there is an early scene where xxmaj johansson , for no reason central to the movie , allows herself to be gotten drunk , and seduced , by a powerful , older director . \" xxmaj seduced \" is a euphemism for what happens . xxmaj it 's a \" slam , bam , i 've got ta go \" kind of moment . xxmaj it bears no relation to the plot whatsoever , and it cheapens xxmaj johansson in the viewer 's eye . xxmaj why did xxmaj allen add that unnecessary scene to the movie ? xxmaj because it shows a powerful director -
